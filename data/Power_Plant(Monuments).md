# Layout

 
Large, concrete structure located roughly in the middle of the plant's premises.
There is a coal chute tower with a conveyor belt connected to both a processing facility and a train car loading bay with silos.
There is also an area with tall, scalable metal constructions.
The Power Plant features an elaborate system of piping interconnecting the cooling towers with the rest of the complex.
On the outskirts one would find a small sheet metal shed and an entrance to the pipe system. The pipe system is also connected to two empty coalpits.
# Infrastructure

The Power Plant offers access to a number of different public utilities.
It contains 3 Recyclers, two of which is behind a green card door. 
Items can be repaired with the aid of the several Repair Benches found inside the elongated sheet metal building.
There are also two Oil Refineries present - one inside the small sheet metal shed on the outskirts and the other one in the two storey sheet metal house with the slanted roof.
A publicly available Pump Jack is located on the outskirts.
A Research table can be found behind the blue card door.
# Loot

 
All types of loot containers, with the exception of the Oil Barrel, may spawn on the Power Plant's premises.
Regular loot Barrels (occasionally Trash Cans as well) and Food Crates spawn on all ground levels, streets and around the plant itself.
All variants of the Large Wooden Crate spawn, typically, on the upper level of the cooling towers, inside abandoned, crashed train cars, inside the buildings and on their rooftops.
Green Military Crates usually spawn on the upper levels of both cooling towers, on building rooftops and on the top most level of the fuel storage sheet metal constructions.
