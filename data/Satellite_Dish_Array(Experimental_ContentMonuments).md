# Layout

 
The Satellite Dish Array is set up on a hilly area and features a completed satellite dish, a second satellite dish and a pillar foundation still under construction, several satellite dishes and other components scattered about and buried in the dirt, and a couple of sheet metal sheds.
The two satellite dish constructions are scalable via a staircase that wraps around them.
# Infrastructure

The Satellite Dish Array provides access to a Recycler, located inside the foundation of the unfinished satellite dish. As of update 158, the completed satellite dish does not offer a Repair Bench any longer, but instead a Research Table.
# Loot

 
The Satellite Dish Array area and its outskirts are littered with regular loot Barrels and Food Crates, rendering the monument a popular place for quickly obtaining components.
Occasionally, large Medical(or Supply) Crates and green Military Crates may spawn inside the two sheet metal sheds.
If a player has an Electric Fuse and Green Keycard it is possible to complete a Puzzle to unlock a green door to obtain Blue Keycard
