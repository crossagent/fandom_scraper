# Intro

In Rust, like in real life, practice makes perfect. But knowing what to practice to improve Player vs Player (PvP) skills could be crucial to your improvement.
# Tips

Position the middle of your screen at the level where enemies may appear.
The most common beginner's mistake is to look down all the time, where half of your screen is occupied by the ground. When you do this, it takes longer to aim at your opponent because you need to move your mouse more. Pretend that there is an invisible crosshair on your screen, and always keep it at the level where you can expect your enemies to be at.
Don't take the fights you know you're not gonna win.
Let's be honest, if you're reading this article then you should know better than solo fighting against enemies that have 8 people in their group. Taking such unnecessary risks is not a good idea when you're just learning how to be better at PvP.
Never stand still, strafe.
Instead of standing on the same spot, keep making micro-movements in all directions to prevent your enemies from getting easy shots on you. The same goes for fighting, Rust does not punish your accuracy if you shoot while moving, yet making you harder to hit.
Consider standing up while shooting automatic weapons instead of crouching.
Most of the automatic guns excluding M249 (standing with M249 makes its recoil spread more) are the same while shooting standing, moving or crouched. Standing allows you to move faster therefore harder for your enemies to hit.
Heal up with medical syringes instead of bandages mid-fight even if it's inefficient.
Sometimes it may seem like you have enough time to bandage up, use a medical syringe but then you get killed because you were in the middle of healing instead of holding your weapon out. It's better to be inefficient while healing instead of dying, just use a medical syringe and worry about gathering resources for them later.
Know what time is the best for each weapon.
Taking an Assault Rifle 8 hours into a vanilla wipe to a monument may seem like a good idea on some servers where fast progression is possible because of big group sizes but is it worth it? Would taking that Assault Rifle actually be helpful and the reward would be greater than the risks? Fighting with a better weapon may seem like it's a good idea, but if you only get worse guns in return then consider using same tiered weaponry as your enemy to increase the reward while decreasing the risk.
Know what weapon is the best for your environment.
Taking Custom SMG to an open field fight is a horrible idea because of its short-range, where a Semi-Automatic Rifle would be way better. But Custom SMG would shine in a close-range fight such as in a Launch Site building, or your local Oxum's Gas Station. You can also combine both of the worlds and use a Thompson since it's the best for medium-ranged fights. The same goes for any other weapon, learn what scenarios work the best for you and use those weapons.
Loot enemies properly.
Don't stand still while looting enemies, strafe to decrease the chance of you getting sprayed down. Focus on the better gear first, if your inventory is full, instead of throwing stuff away and standing there consider leaving with what you can before someone else joins the fight, don't get greedy.
# Where to begin practicing

The most important step is to practice your gun skills. Some servers are better for this than the others. For example, servers where you spawn in with a kit or a gun and can shoot right away, are better for this. To find such servers go into your Rust server browsers and click on the "Modded" servers tab. Search for keywords such as "aim train". This should lead you to a list of servers similar to each other which offer arenas for you to fight with players and game modes such as aim train/targets/aimbots. In these game modes, you can try shooting every gun in the game on AI targets that are moving/standing still. You can learn spray patterns, gun handling and recoil patterns. Another type of aim train servers is "battlefield" servers. On these servers, you spawn on a map with a kit where you can begin to fight immediately. This type of server offers more of an unscripted environment where you have no idea where your enemies are.
Server examples:
Perfect Aim Train (combat arenas, targets, free for all, etc.)
UKN.GG (combat arenas, targets, free for all, etc.)
RustyNation (battlefield)
# Tracking your progress

Perhaps the best way to track your progress would be to make an ~hour long recordings of your gameplay every month and compare them to see how you are doing. Another, more numeric tracking technique is to use services that track your stats like RustStats.gg. It may not be the best at being accurate considering everything you do in Rust that may affect your stats but it can be a good overall estimate of how you're doing.
