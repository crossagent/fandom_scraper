# Weapons

 
(Click here to learn more about Weapons) 
Rust Legacy featured some interesting weapons based on real life army grade rifles and pistols (such as the M4, MP5A4, 9mm Pistol, Shotgun, etc). There were also some make-shift weapons (such as the Revolver, Pipe Shotgun, Hunting Bow, etc), that were generally frowned upon by the community. However, Rust Experimental seems to focus more on the make-shift style by introducing weapons with more rustic looking designs. One thing to note about the gunplay in Legacy is that bullet paths were a lot more predictable. Bullets tended to travel in fairly straight lines which rewarded players for skill rather than luck. Recoil was also largely reduced when compared with Experimental and muzzle flashes tended to be less distracting. This resulted in fairly simple yet effective gunplay mechanics which encouraged precise and accurate shooting rather than spraying. The only problem with these mechanics is that they were somewhat unrealistic and made it difficult for more inexperienced players to succeed in firefights.
One additional thing to note is that all medical items such as the Small Medkit and the Large Medkit could be used immediately without any delay. This resulted in players being able to spam Medkits in order to regain full health very quickly, therefore making them very difficult to kill in a firefight. One way to deal with this problem was to wait until the player(s) ran out of Medkits, but this could take a very long time depending on how many they had. One effective solution to this problem was to flank players and kill them before they had a chance to replenish their health. 
To unlock the crafting recipes for many of the military grade (high tier) weapons, players needed to research them with a Research Kit or find their corresponding Blueprints. Some of the more rudimentary (low-tier) weapons such as the Revolver and Pipe Shotgun could be crafted by default (assuming the player had the necessary resources to do so). 
# Building

Building in Legacy was very different to the current version of Experimental Rust. In many ways, the building mechanics were a lot simpler but were also unforgiving of error. To name a few differences; there were no Tool Cupboards, Building Plans or Hammers. This meant that players could not set Building Privilege around their bases which lead to the emergence of many unique raiding strategies. In order to counter these raiding strategies, a widely accepted method was developed by players which involved surrounding their bases with Wood Foundations and Wood Pillars. Because foundations and pillars were almost indestructible, this method worked quite effectively. The metal variants also worked for this.
The only way players could demolish structural items that they had placed themselves was to manually destroy them using explosive items such as F1 Grenades or Explosive Charges. However, they were quite expensive and were best used to raid other player's bases. It should be noted that foundations and pillars could not be destroyed without access to admin controls. Additionally, structural items could not be rotated once placed, however, this did not matter as both sides of structural items were equally strong.
 
Because there was no height limit on how high players could build, many players proceeded to build extremely tall bases. This created numerous problems for raiders trying to raid extremely tall base designs. However, most players who still wanted to collect and store loot had to have a staircase up to the top, therefore meaning that the base could be raided if the raiders had enough Explosive Charges to get to the top. One clever player also managed to invent a so-called 'unraidable base' design, but fortunately, these bases could still be raided (although it was very difficult).
One of the most significant building changes, when compared with Experimental, was the fact that all players had to manually craft and place individual structural items. This meant that there was an increased risk to the building process as structural items that were crafted but not placed were at risk of being stolen during raids. This forced players to be smart when planning their builds as they needed to ensure that they had enough (but not too much), of every structural item needed to build their desired base.
