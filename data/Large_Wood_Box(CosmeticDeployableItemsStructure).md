# Usage

 
To place the Large Wood Box you must move the item to your hotbar and then move your mouse around until the red box becomes blue (Indicating that it can be placed). After placing the box, you can add a Code Lock to increase security. To use the box and see the contents inside, as well as being able to take items out/ put them in, align the cursor to the box and press the Use button (default "E"). 
If a code lock is attached, intruders will have to destroy the box to gain access to its contents. Some items (8-15 slots) will be lost upon destroying it.The box can be destroyed with approximately 18 hits from a Pick Axe. 
# Trivia

Storage Boxes and similar containers that have not been secured with a locking mechanism(e.g. Key or Code Lock) may be freely accessed by other players.
Large wood boxes also suffer from decay, that means if you raid a decaying house, the loot might have decayed away.
