# Usage

A Raw Chicken Breast could be consumed by a player by putting it into their Hotbar and pressing the specified key of 1-6. Additionally, players could also consume it from anywhere in their inventory by hovering their mouse over the item and then clicking on it with their right-mouse button after which they could select the 'Eat' option.
Additionally, Raw Chicken Breasts could be turned into Cooked Chicken Breasts by cooking them in a Camp Fire. This was preferable to eating them raw. 
# Obtaining

Raw Chicken Breasts could be obtained in just one way:
By harvesting killed Animals.
Note: They could also be stolen from other players. 
# Notes:

Much to the amusement of players, Raw Chicken Breasts could be obtained by harvesting any animal. Ironically, there were no Chickens in Legacy. However, many players didn't seem to mind.
The in-game description for Raw Chicken Breasts did not warn towards their potential to cause Poisoning. This meant that many players had to discover this for themselves.
