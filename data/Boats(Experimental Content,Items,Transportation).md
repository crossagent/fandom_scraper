# Information

The Boat is a vehicle that is used to travel on water. It needs Low Grade Fuel in order to work, which needs to be placed in the engine part of the Boat, located in the back. 
 
The boat can support up to 4 players, 3 passengers and the driver. The passengers can use items, shoot firearms and interact while sitting in the Boat, while the driver cannot. 
The boat has a Small Stash in the front which can be used as storage. 
Boats can be pushed by standing near and looking at them. This is useful, because they spawn on the coast, rather than on water. 
# Aqcusition

Boats naturally spawn everywhere around the map excluding Cold Zones. 
 
They can also be bought at Fishing Villages located around the edges of the mainland for exactly 125 Scrap. 
 
# Durability

Like any other vehicle in the game, boats will decay over time. It takes 3 hours for a fully repaired boat to decay if not located in a base. If it is inside one, the boat will not decay at all. Boats can also be damaged, eventually causing it to sink. 
The boat can be repaired using a Hammer with Metal Fragments and Wood. If a boat decays, the items inside the Small Stash and the fuel left inside will disappear. 
# Fuel consumption

The boat consumes 360 low-grade fuel per hour or 6 per minute. Fuel has to be placed in the engine part of the boat, located behind the driver seat.
