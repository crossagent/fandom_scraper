# Usage


## As a Weapon

The hatchet is a melee weapon, capable of killing unarmored human players in four hits. As a melee weapon, it has a disadvantage compared to firearms. However, sprinting and zig-zagging toward an enemy with ranged weapons will help close the distance while simultaneously making it difficult for the enemy to aim.
## As a Tool

The hatchet can be used to gather resources. Repeatedly hitting Trees, Wood Piles, Rocks, and fallen animals will give you their resources. It has a major advantage gathering resources from animals compared to the Pickaxe.
It can also be used to break down structures such as Wood Storage Boxes, Sleeping Bags, Camp Fires, Wood Barricades, Wood Shelters, and Wood Doors. 
200 hits will deconstruct Wood Doors. (The Pickaxe is also capable of demolishing these objects/structures).
# Crafting

The Hatchet is made with:
10 Metal Fragments
20 Wood
It takes 20 seconds to craft.
# Trivia

Hitting a Wood Pile with a Hatchet will give you 10 Wood, instead of 7 when using a Rock or the Stone Hatchet while the Pickaxe gives 20.
