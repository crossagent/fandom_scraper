# Trivia

Same as for Bolt Action Rifle, In the earlier versions of alpha, attaching flashlight or laser sight would direct them to the side. It could be fixed by attaching silencer. This bug was fixed in 01/20 update.
Before the Revolver was added, 9mm pistol used to be a default craftable weapon.The 9mm pistol has been removed from the default craftables.
The revolver uses the same rounds that a 9mm pistol uses, which is 9mm 
The Revolver is cheaper than the 9mm pistol, making it a primary choice on early-game players as it acts essentially the same as a 9mm pistol, except with lower firing rate, smaller cylinder size/cartridge count, but with 4 more units of damage, but 4 units of damage less than the P250 (but still much cheaper).
# Inaccuracies

The rounds shown on a fully loaded revolver have dents in all the primers showing that all the rounds have already been fired.
