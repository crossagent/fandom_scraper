# Mechanics

There are 4 levels of crafting.
Basic
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
## Basic crafting

To be able to craft basic items, a player only needs the materials. 
Items that can be crafted like this include the Rock, Torch, Camp Fire, Building Plan, etc.
## Level 1 crafting

To be able to craft Level 1 items, you first need to acquire their Blueprints. These can be obtained by either finding the blueprint or finding the specific item and Research it in a Research Table. 
After researching the item, the player will be able to craft it if standing in AoE of a Workbench Level 1 while having the required materials.
 
## Level 2 and 3 crafting

The same mechanics apply than at Level 1 crafting for Blueprints.
After acquiring the Blueprint, the player will need a Workbench Level 2 or Workbench Level 3, depending on the level of the item, and the required materials for crafting.
# Crafting menu

The crafting menu can be opened by pressing Q by default.
There are categories by which you can search Items, or there is a search bar, where you can type the name of the item you want to craft. 
Once you click on an item, it will display it on the right side of the screen. Below the name of the item, the required level of Workbench will be displayed. If the item is Basic, nothing will be displayed there. At the top right the time needed by default and the amount crafted when crafting 1 of the item will be displayed. At the bottom right of the screen it will tell you what you exactly need for set amount of items crafted (by default: 1). If the crafting material is displayed in yellow, it means you don't have the required amount, if it's displayed in white. 
You can set the amount of how many you want to craft of an item, either by using the + and - buttons, typing it in or pressing the max icon. When pressing the max icon, it will set the amount to the maximum depending on your resources in your inventory.
 
When pressing TAB, a Quick Crafting Menu will be seen on the right side of the screen. By left clicking on one of the items there, it will start crafting it. By middle clicking, it will queue up 5 items to craft (if possible). By right clicking on an item that's being crafted or is in queue, it will be canceled and the resources will be given back to the player.
In the normal Crafting Menu right clicking the orange X on an item in queue will immediately push it to the front, but left clicking it will cancel the crafting of it.
# Time bonuses

Time bonuses can be applied to crafting by a Workbench. 
If standing in AoE of a Workbench, depending on the level of it, and the level of the item you are crafting, you will get a time bonus.
If an item is the same level as the Workbench you are standing near, no time bonus will be applied
If an item is 1 level below the Workbench you are standing near, the crafting time will be halved.
If an item is 2 levels below the Workbench you are standing near, the crafting time will be 1/4 of the normal time.
If an item is 3 levels below the Workbench you are standing near, the crafting time will be 1/8 of the normal time.
