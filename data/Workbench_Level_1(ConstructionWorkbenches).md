# Crafting

The Workbench Level 1 takes 60 seconds to craft and requires the following:
500 Wood
100 Metal Fragments
50 Scrap
# Mechanics

The Workbench Level 1 is used primarily for unlocking blueprints via a tech tree using scrap, but can also be used as a station to refill Diving Tanks and the Jackhammer. It can also be used to craft the next level of workbench, the Workbench Level 2.
To use the Workbench, first place it in a suitable location and press the Use key to interact (default: E). Once opened, pressing the "Open tech tree" button will reveal a tree of blueprints to learn. The blueprints must be learned in a specific order, but there are multiple branches that allow progress into different areas. To learn a blueprint, players must have the amount of scrap stated, and must have unlocked all blueprints prior.
 
Researching an item does not allow players to skip through parts of the tech tree, but will still allow players to craft that item. In addition, once an item has been researched, players will not have to pay additional scrap to bypass that item in the tech tree . Once a player has learnt all available blueprints of that workbench level, they will lose the ability to research more and be given a message stating that they have learnt all available blueprints of that level.
Players can also use the Workbench to refill Scuba Tanks and Jackhammers. Simply open the Workbench, select either the Scuba Tank or Jackhammer and click "Refill" option. Note that refilling tanks and jackhammers will cause a small amount of permanent damage, limiting their maximum capacity or use (similar to using a Repair Bench).
