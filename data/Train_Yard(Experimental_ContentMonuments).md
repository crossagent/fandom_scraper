# Layout

The Train Yard comprises of several tall, concrete buildings, a couple of sheet metal sheds, a climbable tower, metal pipes and two freight cranes - all scattered about the railroad tracks, upon which abandoned railway carriages rest. 
There are numerous ways in which the sewers underneath can be accessed.
There is a storage facility in front of the main building, filled with stacked shipping containers; nearby is a railroad coal chute.
