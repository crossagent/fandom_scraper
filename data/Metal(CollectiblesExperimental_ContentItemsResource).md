Metal Fragments are a type of resource, used mainly in the crafting of various items or as a building material in player made structures. The main, and by far easiest and safest way to obtain metal fragments are to mine Metal Ore from Rocks, then smelt the ore using a Furnace or Large Furnace.
Other ways metal fragments can be obtained include:
Breaking down items in a Recycler
Smelting/cooking empty cans
Looting other players
Melting metal ore
# Usage & Crafting

Metal fragments are extensively used in crafting and repair, and just some of the many uses include:
Attire, such as Boots.
Armor, such as the Coffee Can Helmet and the Riot Helmet.
Weapons, such as the Waterpipe Shotgun, Crossbow and Semi-Automatic Rifle.
Constructing and repairing Sheet Metal building components.
Repairing items originally made using metal fragments.
Used to craft traps and such.
