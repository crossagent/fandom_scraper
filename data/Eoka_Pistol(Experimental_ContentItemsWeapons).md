# Trivia

The Eoka Pistol can only fire Handmade Shells, 12 Gauge Buckshot, 12 Gauge Incendiary Shells, and 12 Gauge Slugs.
It is possible to kill an armored player in one shot at a very close range with the Eoka Pistol when chambered in 12 Gauge Buckshot.
The pistol is modeled after a weapon made by the EOKA (Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston, or in English "National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters") a Greek Cypriot nationalist guerrilla organization which fought against British rule of Cyprus from 1955-1959. The real life weapon was made with a carved wooden handle lashed to a barrel consisting of a spent 20mm cartridge with a hole drilled in the top to allow ignition of the explosive to propel the rock or other projectile.
The Eoka Pistol is a fairly popular early game raiding tool, allowing a single player to destroy a Wooden Door in around two and a half minutes (variable according to the firing mechanism) by firing 45 Handmade Shell at it. This remains as one of the fastest ways to destroy a Wooden Door for an early player.
