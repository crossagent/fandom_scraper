# Graphics Quality (Setting)

Graphics Quality is a setting in Experimental Rust that affects the overall graphics level of the world in general. This setting can be found in the settings panel in-game by pressing the F2 key by default. It is a slider that can be adjusted to suit your needs, and the possible values are 0-5, 5 being the best, 0 being the worst. When adjusting this setting, be warned that it may take quite some time for your computer to load the new graphics into the game.
