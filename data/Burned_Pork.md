# Crafting

Burned Pork cannot be crafted directly on its own. 
Instead, it can be obtained by leaving already Cooked Pork in an ignited Camp Fire for a couple of minutes. And if you leave it there long enough it becomes charcoal.
# Trivia

Burned Pork can occasionally be found in regular loot Barrels, various Loot Crates and Supply Air Drops.
If you accidentally burn meats such as pork, they still have a use: Burned items still work as fishing bait in the survival fish trap.
