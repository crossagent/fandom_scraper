# Radiation Poisoning

 
Radiation Poisoning is the disadvantageous effect that is applied whenever the player enters a Radiation Zone. While under its effect, the player's screen will start to get fuzzy, a Geiger Counter's clicking sound will play (intensity depending on the effect's intensity) and the player will lose health and eventually die. The player will also be unable to run if their radiation poisoning exceeds 100. Radiation Poisoning can be prevented by various means, most commonly including:
Radiation-resistant clothing
Anti-Radiation Pills
Medical Syringes
Water
