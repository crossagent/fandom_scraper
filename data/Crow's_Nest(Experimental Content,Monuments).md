# Crow's Nest

{'title': "Crow's Nest", 'content': "The Crow's Nest is a generated structure in the world of Rust. It can be found near and in radtowns and bigger monuments, specifically places like the Water Treatment Plant and Nuclear Power Plant. The Crow's Nest is a small, rusted metal tower with a spiralling staircase that leads to the top. It is usually a place where loot crates can be found and occasionally, you might find a small group of Crow's Nests (sometimes connected together by overhead walkways). Crow's Nests aren't normally generated on their own, and you will probably only see them as a part of a radtown.\n \n "}
