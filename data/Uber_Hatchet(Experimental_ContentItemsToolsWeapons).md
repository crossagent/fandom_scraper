{'title': 'Uber Hatchet', 'content': 'The Uber Hatchet is a tool in Rust Experimental that can only be spawned by Admins. Admins use it to undo griefing and object spam, as it can instantly destroy any placed structure or object, and deals an exceedingly lethal amount of damage to any entity that gets hit by it (players included). The Uber Hatchet can not be crafted or found by regular players.'}
