# Crafting

The Floor Grill can be crafted with:
75 Metal Fragments
# Large Furnace

The Floor Grill is the only ceiling/floor that
can be placed above a Large Furnace. This is
commonly thought to have been changed after the
update that let players build twig structures in an unauthorised building area, in order to allow players to protect their furnace from raiders.
