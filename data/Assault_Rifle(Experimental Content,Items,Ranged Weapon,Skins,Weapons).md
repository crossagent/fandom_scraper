The stock of the weapon is actually the handle of a shovel; this is likely a parody of the many uses of an AK, because they have been rumoured to have been used in the field for as many things as frying eggs or digging holes. It might also be a reference to the famous gallery demonstrating a person making a fully functional AK out of a shovel (link)
Can be obtained from the Attack Helicopter
Although it resembles the AK-47 it is actually based on the AK-103.
