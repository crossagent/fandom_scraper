# Experimentation

 
(Outdated information) As of devblog 185, Workbenches can now be used for Blueprint researching as well, with the major difference of yielding random blueprints. Depending on which Workbench you use, you get different random blueprints belonging to the crafting tier of the respective Workbench. For example a Work Bench Level 1 Experiment might yield a Floor Grill blueprint, but not a Large Furnace blueprint.
## Mechanics

(Outdated information) In order to experiment at a Workbench, simply put the required amount of scrap in the upper slot and press the then appearing "Begin Experiment" button. The Interface will then be locked for a short duration and closing the Workbench's interface will not cancel the experiment. After finishing, a random - previously unknown blueprint to the player initiating the experiment - blueprint will be available in the lower slot.
Note: You need to learn the blueprint before starting another experiment if you don't wish the same blueprint appearing again.
The prices for experimenting at a Workbench vary as their results:
Workbench Tier: Level 1Scrap Cost: 75 Scrap
Workbench Tier: Level 2Scrap Cost: 300 Scrap
Workbench Tier: Level 3Scrap Cost: 1000 Scrap
# Trivia

(Outdated information) Since the duration boost caps at 75% for the second higher tier, a Work Bench Level 3 will provide the same duration boost to a blueprint requiring no Work Bench, as the Work Bench 2 would.
