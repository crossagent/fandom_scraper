# Driftwood

 
Beach Biomes had Driftwood from early on.However, Driftwood was only made a harvest-able Wood Resource with Devblog 167. They provide the same amount of Wood per hit as a Fallen Log. 
# Legacy Version

Although plentiful in the landscape, trees were not the fastest way of obtaining Wood in Legacy. Wood Piles were a much better alternative as they allowed players to gather Wood more quickly. However, when Wood Piles were scarce (and the player only needed a small amount of wood to craft a Wood Shelter or Camp Fire), then Trees were fine. If the player used a Pick Axe on the tree, they could get 2 Wood per hit. In contrast with Experimental Rust, trees in Legacy did not despawn after being fully harvested, and players would see a message stating 'There's no wood left here' if they attempted to continue gathering from it.

# Bugs

Some trees have been seen to be generated inside buildings.
Wooden and Metal Building Parts can be placed inside trees so the tree goes through their house
