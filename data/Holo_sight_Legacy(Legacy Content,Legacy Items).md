Note: Some firearms did not support attachments. 
# Firearms

Below is a list of firearms that mods can be attached to:
9mm Pistol

# Obtaining

Holo sights could be obtained in three different ways:
By crafting them;
Finding them in Loot Crates;
Looting Rad Animals.
# Crafting

Holo sights could be crafted using 5 Low Quality Metal. Doing so would take 7 seconds and yielded one Holo sight. A Workbench was required to them.
# Notes

The Holo sight was incorrectly spelled with a lower case 's' in-game.
The experimental version is called the 'Holosight'.
The real life version is called a 'holographic weapon sight' or 'holographic diffraction sight'.
