# Info

Water Reflections is a graphics effect used to make bodies of water look more realistic by adding a level of reflection to the surface of the water, like in real life. This setting is only available in Experimental Rust. The quality of the water reflections can be adjusted in the F2 key Settings overlay in-game. The setting is a slider with possible values 0-2, 2 being the best, 0 being minimal reflection quality. Water Reflections is set to 2 by default.
