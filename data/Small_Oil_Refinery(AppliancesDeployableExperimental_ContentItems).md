# Usage

The Refinery is used to refine Crude Oil into Low Grade Fuel. Similar to the Furnace it is operated using Wood, and produces Coal as a byproduct.
Once the refinery is turned on, it will stay on until it is turned off, runs out of fuel or runs out of storage space for the products. 
One Crude Oil will be converted into 3 Low Grade Fuel.
# Efficiency

The refinery is quite an efficient way to obtain large amounts of fuel, even though it has to be fueled itself. Given the input of 7 Wood one could convert 1 Crude Oil into 3 Low Grade Fuel. It takes 6 2/3 Wood per Crude Oil, so 1k for 150 cans.

# Crafting

The Small Oil Refinery is not a default recipe. It can be found, or bought at a shop in Scientist Compound (Outpost).
Crafting a Small Oil Refinery costs:
200 Wood
500 Metal Fragments
250 Low Grade Fuel
Notes:
It takes 120 seconds to craft one Small Oil Refinery.
# Trivia

The name could be taken to mean that there was a larger refinery planned.
