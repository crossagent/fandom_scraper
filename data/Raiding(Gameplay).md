# Pick Raiding

Players can hit a component of the structure with a weapon to do enough damage to destroy the component. The component takes a varying number of hits depending on the health and build tier of the component and the weapon used. Here are a few examples of commonly used raiding melee tools:
Tools / Weapons: Wooden SpearTwig Tier (10 hp): 2 hits @ 4 dmg/hitWood Tier (250 hp): UnknownStone Tier (500 hp): UnknownSheet Metal Tier (1000 hp): UnknownArmored Tier (2000 hp): Unknown

# Explosives

Doors require half the amounts.
# Projectile Weapons

Not much is known about the effect of projectiles on the health of structures. A detailed damage list can be found here: Damage Table
However, this we do know: 
Twig and Wood structures are on the weaker side to begin with, but instead of using projectiles it is probably better just to use melee weapons/tools.
Explosive 5.56 Rifle Ammo does greater damage to Sheet Metal and Armored tier structures than typical 5.56 or pistol rounds, although it is still rather inefficient compared to explosives.
A High Velocity Arrow fired from a Crossbow is capable of penetrating through structures of any building tier (except for Stone). This allows someone to shoot a person through a wall, for instance. The arrow cannot penetrate more than one structure.
