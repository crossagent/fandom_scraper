# Durability

It has a maximum of 100HP. It can be picked up with a Hammer, but it will lose HP when doing this.
It can also be repaired with the Hammer using HQM when placed. It can also be repaired in a Repair Bench using less HQM but it will lose 20% of its maximum HP and the player needs to have its Blueprint learnt.
