# Clan War

A clan war is when two groups, or clans (as the slang term is called) fight each other in a quest to gain dominance, resources, or the simple feeling of winning against another clan.
Clan wars include:
Raids on the enemy clan
Slanderous remarks in the Rust chatbox and/or forums about other clans
Flamewars; supporters of a clan or clan members get in online arguments about which clan is better.
Controlling abandoned bases and rebuilding them as strongholds
Building "raid towers" or very tall towers used to get the drop on enemies
(Sometimes) complete destruction of the enemy clan's final base or "last stand" building in order to completely humiliate the enemy clan and brag about it in the chatbox and/or forums.
Clan wars exist in Rust experimental and Rust Legacy.
