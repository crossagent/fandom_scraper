# Layout

The Mining Quarry is located in the center. There are a few barricades and stone slab piles around the area. Two structures exist on quarry Monuments and they are the guard tower and a small shack near that. The Mining Quarry monument has a small no build zone allowing players to build around it and potentially wall it off.
