# Injured (Legacy)

{'title': 'Injured (Legacy)', 'content': 'The Injured status effect can occur from falling or jumping off high places. It keeps you crouched and slows your walking as though you are crafting something. You cannot sprint, and it is very hard (if possible at all) to jump while injured. You will eventually recover after about a minute of being injured. Being injured usually also involves fall damage, as that is usually the method of injury. This effect has been removed from the experimental version of rust and most servers.\nMechanics\nAttack\nDamage Types • Projectiles\nEnvironment\nAnimals • Barrels • Biomes • Flora • Loot Crates • Monuments • Rocks • Trees\nGameplay\nAttack Helicopter • Airdrops • Building • Combat • Crafting • Gathering • Raiding • Repairing • Researching\nPlayer\nFood & Hunger • Health • Hydration & Thirst • Protection • Sleeping • Spawning\nXP System\nExperience • Skill Tree • Tech Tree\nStatus Effects\nBleeding • Building Privilege • Comfort • Injured • Poisoning • Radiation • Starvation & Dehydration • Warmth • Wet & Drowning • Wounded', 'infobox': 'Injured\nType\nStatus\nCrafting\nCraftable\nN/A\nDescription\nForces player to crouch.
