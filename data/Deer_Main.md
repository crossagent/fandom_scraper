When harvested with a Bone Knife or Hatchet, a deer will yield:
10 Animal Fat
50 Bone Fragments
25 Cloth
50 Leather
5 Raw Deer Meat
# Tips

Deer can be a bit hard to hunt, because if the player comes too close to it or damages it, the deer will attempt to sprint rapidly away from the player, at a speed much faster than the player's sprinting speed. However, the deer will eventually slow down, allowing the player to catch up and kill it.
