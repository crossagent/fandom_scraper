# 1. Ration Boxes

Wherever you find barrels, you’ll find ration boxes. They’re a great place to find food, water and even metal fragments. If you find a tin of food, you’ll be given the empty tin upon consuming it, which can be smelted at a campfire into 15 metal fragments. For late-game, you’ll want to avoid ration boxes as you have no need for any of the items it contains but for early-game this is some of the best loot you can find given you start off almost starving and ready to die of dehydration.
