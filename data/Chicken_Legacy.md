# Chicken (Legacy)

The Chicken is a passive animal that will run away if the player gets too close to it. 
They can be killed and harvested for Raw Chicken Breasts, Cloth and Animal Fat. Chickens will emit a sound when the player gets too close. They are much smaller than their counterparts in Experimental Rust.
