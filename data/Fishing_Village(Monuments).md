# Defenses

The fishing village is guarded by auto turrets which will attack any players which are seen as hostile. They are friendly, but only to players that are not holding any weapon (kill-able item) in the hands, with exceptions being the Rock, Torch and Flashlight. The player will have 5 seconds to disarm, if they don't, the turrets will shoot until the player dies.
 
# Loot

No loot can be found inside, however, road loot can be found around it.
# Utilities

Fishing villages do not have any Recyclers nor Workbenches, however there are two NPCs which act as a shop. Both sell full diving gear sets and also some fishing gear.
At one of the vendors you can also buy a Boat for 125 Scrap, a RHIB for 300 Scrap, an One-Man Submarine for 200 Scrap and a Two-Man Submarine for 300 Scrap.
There is also a vending machine which allows players to sell their Fish for Scrap.
