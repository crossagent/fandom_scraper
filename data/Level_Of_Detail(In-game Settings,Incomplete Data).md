# Level Of Detail

{'title': 'Level Of Detail', 'content': 'The "Level Of Detail" setting is a setting in Experimental Rust that acts as a master control slider for the graphics quality and detail of the player\'s game. It can be found in the F2 settings overlay in-game, and is set to 1 at default. The slider can go as high as X, or as low as X. A higher number value will result in better graphics generally, but at a cost of performance. For those looking to optimize their FPS, a lower number is better. The Level Of Detail slider generally adjusts every graphics-related setting.'}
