{'title': 'Raiding kit Guide', 'content': "There are plenty of ways one can raid in rust, but there are a few pointers you should try and follow when conducting any raid. Here are a few short examples.\nIt's always much better to raid in a group. A solo raid is a foolish thing to do. A two-man raid is very doable granted the enemy is either not very skilled, has worse gear than you, or is alone. A three or more man raid is always better.\nIt's always important to have a backup plan. If you go start a raid and bring weapons with you, then get killed by the players whose base you're raiding or by a few players counter-raiding, you'll want something to fall back on. What I mean by this is you want backup gear for a raid. Better have it and not need it, than be killed by counter-raiders and not have a way to get your stuff back.\nOffline raiding is not the noblest of acts, but it's much safer. Instead of having to worry about the player whose base you're raiding as well as any possible counter-raid attempts, you just have to worry about the chance of a counter-raid attempt.\nEco-raiding is when you raid using cheap items such as spearing a wooden door. It's pretty much always a time-consuming process, but if you get good loot out of it then it was most likely worth the time. Just watch out for any counter-raiders.\nWell there you have it, a few short tips you should try and follow when conducting a raid on rust."}
