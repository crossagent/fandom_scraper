{'title': 'M249', 'content': 'â€”Information accurate as of: 1093.71 Update\nThe M249 is a high damage, high rate of fire, belt-fed light machine gun. It is arguably one of the best weapons in the game and can be obtained from looting the crash site of an Attack Helicopter, or from the Bradley APC. The M249 has an extremely large magazine size, which allows for excellent defense capability in the event that you don\'t have time to reload, though do bear in mind that the M249 takes the longest time to reload out of all of the guns. A single magazine holds 100 bullets, and the rate of fire of the M249 is comparable to that of an Assault Rifle. The M249 also suffers from high recoil, so it must be fired in short bursts for best accuracy, repairable as of build "1093.71"\nThe M249 fires all types of 5.56 Rifle Ammo.', 'infobox': 'M249\nHigh damage, high rate of fire, belt fed light machinegun\nGeneral\nShortname\nlmg.m249\nType\nRanged Weapon\nStacksize\n1\nWeapon Stats\nFire Mode\nAutomatic\nHead Damage\n130\nChest Damage\n65\nArms Damage\n55\nLegs Damage\n37\nRecoil\nVery High\nRange\nModerate\nCapacity\n100\nAmmunition\nWeapon Mods\nMod Slots\n3\nCrafting\nCraftable\nNo'}
