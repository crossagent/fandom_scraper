# Killing a Mutated Bear

It can take up to 20 hits with a Hatchet to kill. Using a shotgun is your best bet of killing one of these beasts as 2 close hits within about 3 metres is a straight kill. You can also use a bow to kill but it will take 3 arrows. Upon death it drops a green backpack with no camo (unlike the player backpack which has greyish digital camo) which can contain any of the drops listed below.
