# Recycling

When placed in a Recycler, road signs will yield:
2 High Quality Metal
5 Scrap
# Appearance

The Road Signs appear to be made out of a direction-indication sign, a warning sign, and a stop sign. The "STOP" phrase on the stop sign has had the S scratched out with an unknown implement so that it spells "Top", and has the term "KEK" written below it, a common phrase on the Internet and likely an in-joke as to the attitude of Rust players as a community. (Kek could possibly refer to the World of Warcraft practice of Horde players typing "KEK" which, when displayed in the general chat to Alliance players, would translate to "LOL", and was common as a form of mockery of a defeated enemy in WoW PvP. 
However, put together reads "Top Kek", which is a mutation of the kek meme, referencing a Turkish snack cake of the same name, while simultaneously symbolizing the highest kek.
