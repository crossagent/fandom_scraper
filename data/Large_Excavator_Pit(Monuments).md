# Layout

Excavator Pit is surrounded by a large mass of dirt and rock, with a crater in the center. Within that crater there is (as the name implies) a giant excavator.
The excavator can be climbed in order to access its fuel tank, as well as the controls.
# Infrastructure

The Giant Excavator Pit offers access to a Recycler under the engine startup console.
# Loot

The Giant Excavator's yield per Diesel Fuel is listed below. It takes 2 minutes to consume 1 Diesel Fuel
Stone - 10,000
Metal Fragments - 5,000
Sulfur Ore - 2,000
HQM Ore - 100
Few containers spawn at the Giant Excavator Pit. Food Crates are in abundance, but there is only one spawn for a Basic Crate and one spawn for a Military Crate.
