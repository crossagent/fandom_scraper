# High Quality Bag

 
Bags contain clothes. This is a high quality bag, which means the clothes in this bag are higher quality than in the low quality bag.
The High Quality Bag can be crafted by using 70x Cloth, 5x Wood, 1x Metal
It is commonly accepted that the High Quality Bag can drop any of marketable clothing or armour skin in the game, including non clothes such as satchel charge skins and notable drops such as the grin facemask, punishment mask, fire jacket, etc. 
Due to the origional descrpition it is possible that the facepunch tshirt is on a less common drop table then the remainder of the items
Currently, in November 2021, there are 969 Clothing and Armor pieces listed on the steam marketplace. If we remove the 52 items in the Low Quality Bag that makes the odds of recieving any one item 1/917
