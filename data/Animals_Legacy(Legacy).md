# Notes:

It should be noted that Animals were also a primary source of Leather, as the Cloth gathered could be converted into Leather by cooking it in a Furnace.
Bears were the only animal that yielded Leather by default.
One iconic feature about animals in Legacy was the fact that they all yielded Raw Chicken Breasts when harvested by players.
