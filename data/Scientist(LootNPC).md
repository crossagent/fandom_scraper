# Monument

Most of scientists on the map patrol near or inside monuments. They are agressive and will shoot on sight. The scientists use a navigation mesh to walk around the Military Tunnels and other areas with variation. AI can open doors and destroy barricades if needed. The scientists in the Military Tunnels are typically moderately to heavily armed, and utilize the MP5, LR-300, M92, and, rarely, the Spas-12. Starting or mid-game players should therefore avoid them.
Scientists are moderately skilled in a tactical sense. They will retreat when damaged, attempt to flank players, reload at appropriate times (i.e., not being shot at the time), and appear to call for backup when attacked. Scientists are attracted to light and sound (especially gunfire); it is advised to keep both to a minimum when scientists are nearby.
## Outpost

 
It is possible to spot few scientists at the Outpost. Unlike others, they do not attack the player. They attack players if they hold a weapon for more than five seconds, or if you damaged another player.
# Junk piles

Scientists near roads are more defensive in nature than their counterparts in the monuments. They will only attack if the player comes too close, and will not purse it. They use a Geiger counter to make some research and use a M92 Pistol. An update, helps them to see less through the bushes to make them balanced to fight. With preparation, a starting-game player should be able to fight one, especially since they will appear alone or in pair, rather than with the large groups (4-5, occasionally more) of scientists as in the Military Tunnels.
# Heavy scientists

Heavy scientists refers to scientists heavily armored and protected that show up when the locked crate has been hacked on the Oil Rigs.
# Appearance

Scientists wear a version of Rust's old Hazmat suit, with blue as the primary color and black as the secondary. It is not obtainable without server admin permissions, and can not be crafted or researched. They are also equipped with flashlight, which they use at night, making it better to spot them in the dark. They turn off their flashlight when shooting at players.
## Outpost

Scientists at Outpost, wear a green hazmat suit to make them easier to differentiate.
