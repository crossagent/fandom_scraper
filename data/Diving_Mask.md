# Diving Mask

The Diving Mask is an item that helps to see clearly underwater, enabling a more thorough underwater expedition. It is part of a diving set along with the Diving Tank and the Diving Fins. However, similarly to the Heavy Plate Helmet, the Diving Mask blocks a part of your field of vision.
The Diving Mask can only be found in crates or bought at the Fishing Village for 15 Scraps.
