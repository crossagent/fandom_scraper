# Bleeding (Legacy)

{'title': 'Bleeding (Legacy)', 'content': "Bleeding has a random chance of starting when a player is damaged. When bleeding the player begins to lose health at a rather fast rate. To prevent this the player can use a Bandage or Medkit. As long as the player is not Hungry or Cold, they will start to gain health back over time without using a Medkit.\nBUG: Some players have said they've began bleeding for no apparent reason."}
