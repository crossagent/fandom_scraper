# Crafting

The Water Barrel can be crafted with:
250 Wood
1 Tarp
# Mechanics

To interact with the Water Barrel aim at its spigot and either press the "Use" key to bring up the inventory screen or hold it down to access the Context Menu Wheel.
The Menu Wheel allows one to take a sip (restoring 30 Hydration points and consuming 30 mL worth of water) from the barrel or open its inventory.
Whilst accessing the barrel's inventory, you can select a water container (Left Click) to bring up the Filling Menu, allowing you to transfer water in 100 mL increments from the container to the barrel, or vice versa.
To save time while filling the Water Barrel up, it is possible to splash the contents of a Water Bucket (Left Click to "fire" it) in the approximate vicinity of the barrel. The barrel will then absorb the splashed water, provided the range requirements have been met. If there are several Water Barrels close to where the water has been splashed, the total amount of water absorbed will be equally divided amongst the barrels.
# Trivia

It is possible to deploy the Water Barrel underwater, regardless of the water depth as long as the area is relatively flat.
Water Barrels can be useful for small bases during a siege, but should be considered a luxury instead of a priority. (This is no longer functional)
