# Acquisition

The Minicopter can be bought from the helicopter vendor in Bandit Camp for 750 Scrap. 
# Durability 

The Minicopter has a maximum of 750 hitpoints. Like any other vehicle in Rust, it will decay over time. If not located inside a base, it will decay in 8 hours and if it is inside a base, it will despawn after 36 hours (see 3 July 2020 decay changes) . It can be repaired using a Hammer with Metal Fragments. 
The Minicopter can be damaged by players.
# Fuel consumption

The Minicopter uses 1800 Low Grade Fuel per hour or 30 per minute of flight. To refuel while flying you hold down ALT to Freelook and look back at the Fuel Tank. 
Intuitively, Minicopters use fuel quicker than boats and are quite low-grade intensive. Players or clans should plan to have a lot of low-grade fuel available when flying often.
# Strategy

The Minicopter's occupants are exposed and an effective strategy is to shoot out the pilot, causing the Minicopter to fall and likely crash.
Since it is notoriously difficult to fly the Minicopter, large groups of players (aka "clans") should ensure their pilots are well practiced. An unlucky crash at a crucial moment can lead to huge losses.
Though if a crash seems unavoidable, the Minicopter can be jumped out of on the last second, avoiding taking damage altogether.
