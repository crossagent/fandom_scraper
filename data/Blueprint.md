# Obtaining

The Blueprint for an object can be obtained by placing the source item in a Research Table, and will require an amount of scrap.
Once the player selects craft, a timer will tick down and after it has finished, the original item and scrap will be destroyed, but the player will gain the blueprint for the item.
# Usage

Clicking on a Blueprint in your inventory will display the option to learn the blueprint. This will destroy the blueprint, but the player will gain the ability to craft an indefinite amount of the items learned.
Players can also sell the unlearned blueprint to other players.
Currently, learned Blueprints will remain with you past death and server wipes.
Learned Blueprints will need a relative level workbench to be able to be used, with level one tier being for the most simplistic designs, such as stone spears and hatchets, second tier for more advanced items, such as the road sign jacket and kilt, while the third tier is for the late game level items, such as the assault rifle.
