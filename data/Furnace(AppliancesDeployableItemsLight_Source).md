# Usage

The Furnace can be used after it has been crafted and placed. To place the Furnace you must first craft it and move it to your Hotbar, from here you can move it around until the "Ghost Furnace" has turned Blue (Indicating it can be placed) Once the Furnace has been placed it can be operated by a player (Any number of players can operate it at the same time) and shows an empty 1x6 grid.
To use the Furnace a player must place Wood in it and ignite it.The furnace will burn up to two Wood and create the smelted version of the materials every 30 seconds. Players do not have to be near the Furnace for it to operate, and it will keep burning until it is turned off, runs out of fuel or if any item slot is filled and it cant find space for either the smelted material or charcoal. A byproduct of the process is Charcoal, which you need to make Gunpowder.
Furnaces will smelt all slots simultaneously, so it is more efficient to smelt multiple stacks of the same ore at one time.
# Crafting

The Furnace can be crafted with:
50 low grade fuel
Each low grade fuel craft makes 4 low grade fuel. 13 crafts will make 52 low grade fuel which is enough to create the furnace. Each craft costs 3 animal fat and 1 cloth. Thus, 13 crafts will cost 39 animal fat and 13 cloth.
100 wood
200 stones
# Repairing

The Furnace can be repaired with a Hammer:
27 low grade fuel
50 wood
98 stones
The Furnace can be repaired with a Repair Bench:
25 low grade fuel
50 wood
100 stones
Max Condition Loss = 20%
# Smelting Rates

In Rust the conversion rates are usually 1:1.
