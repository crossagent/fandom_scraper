# Spawning

 
Underwater Diving Sites spawn in the ocean naturally. They can be identified by a small water bottle floating on the surface of the water. 
# Approaching

It is necessary to use a Diving Tank when looting these kind of areas. A Diving Mask, Diving Fins and a Wetsuit is also recommended when swimming down.
# Loot

Sunken Chests and Sunken Boxes can be found in the area of diving sites. These need to be untied first. When untied, they will float up to the surface, where they can be opened and looted.
