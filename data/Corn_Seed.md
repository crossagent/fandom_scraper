# Obtaining

You receive Corn Seeds by eating Corn.
# Placing seeds

To place seeds which will result in a corn plant (on which corn will grow), you need to put the seeds in your hotbar and then left-click somewhere on the ground. It's a good idea to choose a hot, sunny and watery place to put the seeds at. There, plants grow better.
# Trivia

Eating one Corn gives you one Corn Seed, as well as the typical nutrition benefits.
