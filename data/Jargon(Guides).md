# Jargon

Jargon in Rust refers to the commonly used abbreviations and terms used by the player base of Rust.
# Classifications of players


## Naked

If you are a Naked, then you are a noblob. A Noblob is a player without clothing items on their character. This range usually doesn't include shoes or hats but that is dependent on both the distance at which they have been spotted, and the 'hunter' themselve.
Most Nakeds are usually carrying a bow or a spear as a form of self defence. Nakeds can also be seen carrying Waterpipe Shotguns and Eoka Pistols.
Nakeds are often seen farming for resources but are usually very wary of their surroundings. Nakeds are sometimes Rust veterans that can take down a Geared guy with a bow or crossbow.
## Fresh Spawn

If you are a Fresh Spawn, you have just spawned in the game world. Everyone in Rust begins as a Fresh Spawn and has to survive until such a time as they are Geared.
Fresh spawns are often confused with Nakeds because of their bare skin, but be wary because Nakeds can also have weapons whereas Fresh Spawns tend to have rocks. One should be considered a Fresh Spawn if the spawn is witnessed, otherwise classify as Naked.
Fresh Spawn is more used in friendly communication than it is in battle communication. Battle communication preferring Naked to Fresh Spawn. In the friendly context, one could say "I am a Fresh Spawn" and many would understand their plight and leave them alone, as killing them wouldn't give them anything. However, most will be killed anyway by those who are Geared, Fully Geared, or KOS players.
## Friendly/Fake Friendly

A friendly is a random player that doesn't kill you on sight, usually tries to talk to you, and moving close to you and ask if you're new or if you're just a naked. They can be either a naked themselves, or geared. A friendly can be a double edged sword, usually these players will claim they are friendly to lower another player's guard and kill them to take their stuff. Or sometimes they'll drop a few supplies for you to help you out.
There's also this other "somewhat" friendly player that will down you, take some things that they need, and help you up/leave you alone.
## Geared

If you are Geared, it usually means you have a gun and some armour equipped. Geared players are often careless and often succumb to the harsh reality of Rust and Fully Geared players.
Geared players are usually carrying a semi automatic rifle with plenty of bullets. They are also outfitted with most commonly wooden armour as it is cheap and you can wear clothes under it compared to the bone armour.
Geared players tend to begin killing as many Nakeds and Fresh Spawns as they can find. This asserts dominance in the pack and establishes territory. Being Geared you might not have lots of territories yet, but the territory you do have will be often frequented by Nakeds and Fresh Spawns.
Geared players are usually too much for Nakeds or Fresh Spawns to fight and if one is encountered you should probably back away as quickly as possible. Geared players are most vulnerable when they are farming because they often go out to farm with their new gun and wooden armour. This makes for an easy kill if you can sneak up with a bow or crossbow and get several headshots.
Geared can be used in both a battle and friendly context, the former being used to identify them as a threat and the latter being used to describe your state to your mates.
## Fully Geared

Fully Geared players are the highest tier of player in Rust, they are the alpha males or females of the pack. Usually, Fully Geared players move inland and away from Fresh Spawns. This allows them to focus on raiding rather than asserting their dominance.
Fully Geared players are easy to identify, they have most likely an AK with plenty of ammo and roadsign armour. This makes Fully Geared players very formidable opponents as they can quickly dispatch lightly armoured targets at medium range. To have a proper chance at defeating a Fully Geared player you need to be at least Geared or higher. If you are just Geared then it would be helpful to have a friend set up a sniper tower near their base to get them while they go to farm.
Fully Geared players usually don't go out with their gear on unless they are raiding. Geared raiders are often unable to repel counter raiders because of their poor equipment. Fully Geared raiders, however, have a good survival instinct and are sometimes Rust veterans so are formidable opponents even for a prepared counter raid party.
The territory of Fully Geared players is usually large and covers the area around their base within a 1km radius.
## Roof Campers

These players camp on extremely high towers and camp with a sniper rifle, sniping anyone they can find. Universally hated among other players.
## KOS

Kill On Sight players shoot first, ask no questions later, basically. They are players of hostile disposition to anyone they encounter, who ignore or reject any attempt of dialogue between individuals not affiliated with them, and will promptly murder anyone of equal or less firepower capacity, for loot and whatnot. Depending on their own resources and reserves, they may even recklessly engage superior forces only for the thrill of it.
## Roleplayer

Contented term, but may be reasonably appraised as the opposite of the KOS player: individuals open for dialogue, not necessarily set for PVP (player vs player) gameplay. Varied (nonviolent) endgames can be observed: building and collecting at their own pace, exploring the world, helping players in need.
## Farmer

Player that mostly farms resources and loot and rarely engages in player vs player activities. Farmer can also be used as a suffix in cases where a player consistently loots from the same type of event/monument. For example, if players use oil rig as their constant source of loot consecutively, they are commonly referred to as "oil rig farmers".
# Material Jargon


## High Qual or HQM

High Qual or HQM is what is known as High Quality Metal, usually used as a gauge of how Geared or Fully Geared a player or group is. An example: "How much High Qual you got mate?" "I got 50 HQM back at base!"Usually referenced as High Qual in voice chat and HQM in chat.
## AK

An AK refers to the AK47 assault rifle variant found in the game. AK users are usually Geared close to becoming Full Geared.
## GP

Short of Gunpowder. Which is required to craft ammunition and explosives.
## Raid Gear

Raid Gear usually means things like ladders and building supplies but can also mean rockets and c4 explosives. Be careful who you announce to that you have Raid Gear as they will often raid you for it.
## Pipe

Short for Waterpipe Shotgun.
## Bolty

Short for Bolt action rifle.
## Pumpy

Short for Pump Shotgun

# Clan Jargon


## Clan

A Clan is a gathering of players in Rust usually larger than 3 and can consist of hundreds of members.
When you are a Clan there are certain opportunities open to you for easy resource gathering and raiding.
Clans can use a method of mass suicide to obtain variable amounts of animal fat and human meat. They can also all run out Naked and dominate farming with their numbers.
A tactic yet to be seen in Rust is a system of Clan cells where a few members of a clan are split off into cells and operate separately from the clan, but swear fealty to them in the end.
## Zerg

A Zerg clan is defined by their qualities of generally being bad at Rust and relying on numbers to overwhelm an enemy.
Chinese Zerg clans have been known to have hundreds of active members. A clan could be classed as Zerg by a solo player if they contain 10 people, but a larger clan may classify a Zerg with over 50 people.
# Gameplay Terms


## Airlock

It means building 2 front doors to block anyone from entering, even when they are open. It's starts with building a triangle formation in front of a door that is opening outwards, and then adding another door that opens inwards from the outside, creating an airlock.
## Honeycomb

A base building technique to reinforce a base by building outwards, typically with triangles, and surrounding it with walls. This is usually done to discourage eco raids, up the amount of explosives to raid, and hide expensive upgrades (like armored walls) and thus reduce a raider's attention to raid it. Term is given for the base layout looking similar to honeycomb.
## Baiting

Baiting can mean a lot of ways, baiting the turret to shoot at you to make it run out of ammo, baiting a player into a snap trap or land mine, or baiting an enemy player to shoot you down, and then your friend shoots them.
## Counter Raid

It means when a group of players kill another group of players in the middle of raiding another player's base. Often times raiding the base in their place, but rarely they'll let the owner keep the base and only take what they wanted.
## Dipping

Means running away/retreating. When you are overwhelmed in a fight, you dip to avoid losing your kit or rare loot.
## Door Camping

It means waiting for a player outside the door for them to leave to ambush them. This gives the victim no other options to leave or time to react. Extremely annoying and frowned upon.
## Doinked

It means when you headshot a player with only one, single shot. Usually used with Hunting/Compound Bow, and Sniper Rifles. Alternative terms are 'Dink' (from CSGO) and 'Headshot.'
## Kit

It means an armor set with a weapon, usually a gun. Examples are an AK kit, MP5 kit, SMG kit, etc.
## Online Raiding

Raiding players that are online to actively defend their base.
## Offline Raiding

It means raiding a player's base when they are offline, which is why having at least stone walls is essential.
## Boom

Explosives of any kind. Timed Explosive Charges, Rockets, Explosive Ammo, Satchels, Beancan Grenades, etc.
## PVP

Player versus player. Hostile interaction between players.
## PVE

Player versus environment. Engagement of players against AI (Artificial Intelligence) entities in the world, like the Helicopter, the Tank, Animals, and Scientists.
## Profit

Loot from a raid that is worth more than whatever was used to get to the loot. An example would be spending 20k sulfur's worth to get more than 20k sulfur's worth of loot.
## RadRun

Radiation Run. Where a player / players go out and loot irradiated monuments. Usually results in inexperienced players losing their gear.
## Raiding

It means that you or your group brute forces/sneaks into another player's/clan's base, killing the players inside and take as much loot as you can. Raiding usually requires items like Building plan, C4, ladder, satchel charge, guns with explosive ammo, or a rocket launcher.
## Splash damage

A trait rockets, thrown grenades, and explosive ammo have to deal damage to more than one tile of a base. This can be useful to destroy more at a reduced sulfur cost. It's important to build your base wisely to prevent splash damage when raided.
## Eco raiding

Raiding using less expensive methods, typically without explosives. Examples include Eoka raids, where one uses Eoka Pistol and typically handmade shells to blast down a wood door. Shotguns and shells to destroy a wood door or wood walls/floor tiles. Flame raiding anything made out of wood. Using tools to break the soft side of any tiles. Eco raiding is preferably done on small or poor base designs where a weakness can be spotted easily and done drawing the least amount of attention. It also can take up a lot more time.
## Foundation Wiping

Destroying the foundations of a base, typically to destroy or grief the base. It's sometimes also used as a way to raid, especially when dealing with a lot of traps or hard to reach loot, but it is very expensive and usually not profitable.
## Grease/Yoink

To steal loot, typically from a ongoing battle or online raid that you're not involved in.
## Roof Camping

These players building extremely tall towers and usually armed with a Bolt-action Rifle or an L96. They stay up there and snipe anyone they can find. Hated by the majority of players.
## Solo/Duo/Trio Servers

Servers that enforce solitary or small groups gameplay, consequently prohibiting clans and preventing big group dynamics (e.g. huge bases, massive raiding parties et cetera) to take place. Players seen coordinating in greater sizes than permitted are kicked out.
## Trap

When a house or structure is built not for storage or shelter but for attracting and ensnaring hapless players. Actual traps may be involved. YouTube offers a plethora of instructional videos showing how to make them.
## TC

TC is short for "Tool Cupboard", it's for maintaining the base to prevent it from decaying.
## Farming

Dedicated gathering of resources and components. Common for players to farm naked, so as not to risk the loss of more important items if contact is made.
## Stream Sniping

When a player precisely goes after a live-streaming individual, having seen, in real time, where he is and what he's doing. Divisive discussion, also among the Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds community. The earliest form of Streamsniping appeared in the first iterations of Dayz, in 2012.
Going Deep
When a player gets access to an open door within an opponent's base. It's not classified as an actual raid, because the player didn't actually use any resources to destroy the base. The attacking player can now pass through and go "deeper" into the base. "Full Deep" is when the attackers gain access to the main loot room with the tool cupboard. This is why having multiple doors in between the exit and the main loot room is extremely important. If the attacker is "Full Deep", they may be able to destroy the opponent's tool cupboard and sleeping bags.
## Wipe

Recurrent mechanism of a server, in which from time to time a new island is formed, making players start from scratch. Knowing when was the last wipe makes for an estimate of player progression, i.e. the more time a server goes beyond the last wipe, the more established and better equipped players, and clans, will be.
There's an ongoing discussion as to the state of the game regarding server wipe and the speed in which players progress, based on the Component mechanic of the game. Some players point to the relative speed in which high tier weapons can be acquired in comparison to slower progression mechanics of earlier stages, in the form of Blueprints and Experience
Some servers give out raiding supplies (rockets, ladders, etc) to encourage raiding on wipe day. It is not advised to play seriously on a sever just before the wipe because the amount of fully geared players will be at its highest, and they will be out looking for a raid. Joining just after a wipe is commonly the best time to join a server because the clans (if any) haven't had time yet to rebuild their base and restock the supplies they lost in the wipe.
## Loaded

Meaning a crate or corpse has filled to the brim with an extensive amounts of loot. Usually a fully geared player is considered loaded, since they usually have high tier armor, some guns, high tier farming tools like the Icepick or Salvaged Axe, some clothing, and resources. Crates that are filled with tons of guns, Sulphur, or Gunpowder also means it's loaded.
