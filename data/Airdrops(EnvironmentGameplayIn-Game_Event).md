# Tactics

Other players will almost certainly be dying for the Airdrop loot. Even if you can't spot any other players in your direct area, you might be in someone's line of sight. Snap Traps and Land Mines from the drop itself may be used to booby-trap the drop site, on low population servers, but it is most likely that there will be a firefight, or one player will grab the loot and run.
