# Layout

All Roads are essentially unpaved dirt tracks.
Roads are usually lined with wooden utility poles, most likely electricity posts, which render them easily identifiable from a great distance.
Alongside Roads you may occasionally encounter different types of road signs, power poles, electrical circuit boxes and bus stop shelters, all of which are indestructible.
# Loot

 
Regular loot Barrels and Food Crates may spawn nearby, on either side of the Road along its entirety.
# Infrastructure

Roads do not provide any access to public utilities (e.g: Furnaces, Repair Benches, Smelters, etc). However, Monuments connected to the roads may have certain utilities available. Player built utilities can also be present, but do not rely on finding these.
