# Inventory Basics

Your inventory can be accessed by pressing "Tab". Here, you can arrange your carried equipment and craft items. Every item that you pick up or craft will be placed in the slots in your inventory. The hotbar slots fill first when picking up items, then begin to fill the inventory space.
# Items In Your Inventory

From the start, every player has a torch and a rock. Gather 100 Stone and 200 Wood to craft a Stone Hatchet, but don't throw away the rock just yet. Gather another 100 Stone and 200 Wood to craft a Stone Pick Axe. It is now safe to throw away your rock by dragging it out of your inventory space and it will drop to the floor. Now that you have these basic tools you can begin to gather resources quicker and build up a base.
# Resources

The world of Rust is full of things to collect. This guide will go over the basic natural resources: Wood, Stone, Metal Fragments, High Quality Metal, Sulfur, Cloth. Wood is gathered from trees and fallen logs around the world, it is the resource you will use for building your first base and also to fuel your campfires and furnaces. Stones are used for upgrading your base to Tier 3, which is flameproof. They are also used for crafting things such as Furnaces, Concrete Barricades, Tools, High External Stone Walls. Metal Fragments are made by smelting Metal Ore in a furnace. High Quality Metal is made by smelting High Quality Metal Ore in a furnace, note that it takes longer than Metal Fragments. Sulfur is made by smelting Sulfur Ore in a furnace, used in explosives and ammunition. Cloth is used to make basic clothing items and Low Grade Fuel, it can be harvested from Hemp Bushes or from certain Animals.
# Crafting

From your inventory, select the "Crafting" tab at the top of the screen. To the right of your inventory, you will see a panel of craftable items. For now, select the Campfire item and craft one.
# Campfire

Take the crafted campfire item and equip it from your hotbar. Click to place the campfire when it's "ghost" is green. The campfire is used for both light and item processing. Interacting with the fire (E) will give you the option to extinguish or open the fire. For now, open the fire. Adding more logs will make the fire burn longer. Putting raw chicken into the fire's inventory will allow it to be slowly processed/cooked into cooked chicken. items like metal ore, sulfur ore, and cloth used to be able to be processed in the same way, but now require a furnace (requied for metal ore processing) or other means of processing. Metal ore will produce metal fragments, sulfur ore will produce sulfur, and cloth will produce leather.

# Other Entities

In the game, there are harmless animals, mutant animals, and other players. Animals can be killed for food, but mutant animals (which will fight back!) will drop numerous items upon their death. Dead mutant animals leave a loot sack in the vicinity of their death, as do dead players. You may see other players around the world. They appear as a naked man, or wearing some sort of armour. Beware: not everyone is your friend. Hover over the player's character to see their name. This will help you communicate in the chat. If they start running at you, be prepared to fight back! Murderous players are known as bandits, and are vilified by the community. They will often hunt players at night, so keeping a low amount of light will help you evade attack. Avoid becoming known as a bandit, or else the friendly player bases may reject you when you need them most.
# Homemaking

By now, you've probably noticed the wooden structures around the world. These are player-created homesteads. In your crafting tab, you will find a section of wooden structural items to craft. All wooden building items (except the door and barricade) must be placed on a wooden foundation, which can be crafted. Find a good, safe place to build your home. Craft a foundation and equip it from your hotbar. Clicking when the foundation's "ghost" is green places it. Use your scroll wheel to rotate the foundation during placing, if you wish. You may now begin to add pillars, walls, windows, and stairs in the same manner. The exact nature of every wooden item would be too extensive for this guide, but all the information you need can be found by clicking the item's name in the crafting tab and reading the text below it. If you wish, fortify your home with barricades. Remember, no home is impenetrable. Gradually chopping down buildings with the hatchet is possible, although it takes a long time. To keep your house safe, consider living in a well-regulated community.
# Useful Home Items

In your house, there are three things you should have. First, craft a sleeping bag and place it on the ground like a campfire. If you die, you will return to this bag, albeit without your items. Second, craft a couple of storage crates and place them around your house. Unless someone gets in and raids them, items you place in the crates will not disappear. Be sure to store your crates away from the walls, so that bandits can't reach in and steal your things from outside. Third, craft a door and place it in a doorway. Other players will be unable to open this door, and will receive the notification "It's locked..." when they attempt to open it. At the time of writing this guide, there is no way to open a locked door that isn't yours, other than 2 charges of C4(destroys door).
# Radiation

Main article: Radiation
Some areas are full of radiation. The clicking noise of a Geiger Counter can be heard in these areas. Standing in irradiated causes your rads to go up (check underneath your food bar). If you gain 500 rads, you will start taking damage every few seconds. Standing in clean areas, or eating food (especially 'Small Rations') gradually decreases the amount of rads you have.
# Advanced Technology

Eventually, you will accumulate the resources needed to craft better items. Armor and guns can be made from blueprints. For now, get 40 metal fragments and some gunpowder. Craft a 9mm Pistol and 10 ammo for it. Mouse 2 will let you aim down the sights of your new weapon. Eventually, you may obtain armor, shotguns, and grenades, but the pistol is a prime example of expensive technology.
