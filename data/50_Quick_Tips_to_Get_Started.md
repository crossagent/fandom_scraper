# 50 Quick Tips to Get Started

Learn how to be the king
of the server, raid like a champion, and build the compound of your dreams with
these tips, and remember, stay rusty!
Tools First, Weapons Later
In the first few minutes of spawning into a server, you're faced with a
choice-- tools, or weapons? Since the majority of your success in the game
comes with building bases, killing animals, and mining nodes, be sure to make
tools a priority. Tools like the Stone Hatchet, which takes 200 wood and 100
stone to create, or around ten hits to a node and twenty to a tree, can speed
up your progress on getting a base and tools down exponentially.
Keep Your Bow at Your Side
The bow, which is arguably the most important early-game weapon, is
inexpensive-- you can craft it with 200 wood and 50 cloth, which is fairly easy
to craft. It uses arrows, which can be crafted from 25 wood and 10 stone. If
you are one of the first people to get a bow, you have a definite advantage
over your spear-armed adversaries.
Important Components
Components, which are a staple of the game, are used to make everything
from armor to tools to decorative elements for your base! You can find them in
crates, at monuments, and in barrels along the road. The most useful items that
you can find are springs, gears, and rifle bodies, which you can use to make
guns!
Keep Your Friends Close, and
Monuments Closer
Being close to monuments are important for farming components and using
the recycle at the monuments to get scrap (which you can use to research new
items.) But be warned, having a base close to a monument means that more people
will be out and about near your home, which can make it hard to farm in peace!
Be sure to weigh the risks and rewards of basing near a monument before placing
your main base.
Footsteps Matter
Like in other survival games (and other games in general,) you can
often hear enemies before you see them. Keep an ear out for animals, other
players, and on some modded servers, zombies-- knowing when they are coming can
make a world of difference in your rust experience! Different animals have
different footsteps, which are even distinct from other players. These distinctions
mean that you have the edge on the other players on the server!
Early Game Low-Grade
Early game, low-grade is super important-- you need it to power boats,
create furnaces, and power lamps and lanterns, if you plan on doing anything at
night. You can get low-grade from animal fat and cloth, both of which you can
farm from animals. Farming animals is fairly easy if you have a ranged weapon,
like a bow! Low grade can also be found in mining helmets outside of mines and
in red barrels found along the road and at monuments.
Upgrade!
Keep raiders out and your friends safely inside with an upgraded base.
Materials like stone, which you can reinforce with stone, sheet metal, which
requires metal fragments, and armoured, which you can get with metal frags and
high-quality metal are all harder to raid than wood or twig are. Although these
can be expensive in the early stages of a wipe, they are worth it in the long
run, as they offer more protection of you and your loot!
Watch Rust Build Videos
Looking to build the compound of your dreams? YouTube content creators
pore tirelessly over their builds, which are constantly updated as new updates
for the game come out! A new, crafty base build can be the difference between
an easily raided base and a compound that is virtually unraidable!
 
Try Battlefield Servers
Want to learn the best way to get better with weapons, without losing
them? Try Battlefield servers! You often spawn (and re-spawn as necessary) with
a semi-automatic rifle, AK-47, and Bolt-Action rifle, which are all essential
to learn to succeed at the game! Being able to use these weapons effectively
can be a huge factor in your success from wipe to wipe.
Combat Tag with Your Friends
Want to 1 v 1 one of your friends to prove that you are better? Try
getting into a combat tag server! You can battle it out in single arenas, or
compete on teams against other players. If you want to see more PvP in your
Rust experience, you should definitely check out combat tag servers!
Organize Inventory
Keeping your tools, food, and ammo on your hotbar means that you can
see them at all times, and easily switch to your gun or hatchet as needed.
Knowing how much ammo you have on you is very important, especially if you are
away from your base for a long period of time. Running out of ammo in the
middle of battle can be fatal!
Hidden Sashes
Hiding important guns, explosives, or similar loot? Make a stash!
Stashes can be made from ten cloth, and can be hidden underground. To find a
stash after you've hidden it, look at the ground around where youve placed it.
To help your remember exactly where you put your stash, take a screenshot of
the location! You'll have a perfect record of where you hid it!
Blueprints First, Components
Later
If you've just started on a server, you'll need blueprints-- which can
be found using research table and scrap, which you can find by recycling
components. Blueprints are essential for creating tools and weapons-- without
the blueprint for a gun, you can't make it using the resources that you have!
In later wipes, or later in the wipe, you can keep components, but initially,
prioritize blueprints.
Don't Trust ANYONE
There's a reason that the Rust community has such a big reputation, and
the reason is this-- in Rust, you should assume that everyone is out to get
you-- because most of the time, they are. Whether you've just spawned on the
beach, are out farming, or have everything you could ever need, look out for
other players, and be sure to run or shoot at the hint of danger.
Silent Raid
Want to raid without the big, attention-drawing booms? Try a
semi-automatic rifle, explosive ammunition, and a silencer. This combination,
known as a silent raid, allows you to gain access and take over other bases
quietly and more efficiently, which is great for mid- or late-game players who
aren't interested in the PvP aspect of the game. Since one sheet metal door
requires 65 shots with explosive ammunition, bring a whole stack or two along
per raid in case things go wrong!
Satchel Raiding
If you're really into booms, but don't have the resources for C4
explosives, try satchel raiding! Four satchels are required to blow through a
sheet metal door, and more if satchels turn out to be duds (which happens at
random! The chance of one turning out to be a dud is currently unknown.)
Revolvers
Revolvers are the perfect early to mid-game weapon. They are
inexpensive, easy to use, and scarily accurate. A few well placed revolver
shots can get you new, better gear off of an unsuspecting player. They take
basic pistol ammo, and are perfect in the early game! 
Biome-Based Bases
Want to have a base that is left alone? Build in the snow! Deserts are
great for nodes, which are essential to the game, and forests are full of
trees, cloth, and mushrooms. Decide what you want out of your base, and run
with it! They do come with risks, though-- you need more cloth for clothing in
the snow, deserts can get hot during the day, and forests are full of hiding
places for your enemies to hold against you. 
Islands and Sandbars
Want to use the boats that Facepunch recently added to the game? Try
building on an island or sandbar! Although these builds can be hard to farm
for, they are easy to defend and maintain. Component farming is easy, too, with
the floats and scuba-diving sites present in the game. 
Play with Friends
Rust is best played with friends! Rust is an intense game, and one that
requires lots of time farming, playing, and building. Having friends to play
with makes the game easier and more fun, and allows you to get closer to your
homies!
Solo Only Servers
Don’t feel like playing with your friends on this one? Try a solo-only server!
If you are just starting out and trying to learn the game, solo-only servers
are great-- you get single players out to raid or fight you, instead of whole
groups of people. Solo-only servers are also a great way to make friends and to
build your community, if you’d love to play with friends later on!
Bolt-Action Rifle for Base
Defense
A bolt-action rifle, or bolty as it is colloquially known, is easy to
defend your base with if you are under attack. It is scarily accurate, and with
a 4x scope, which you can make with high-quality metal, you can snipe enemies
from over 100 meters away! It can generally be found in airdrops, made, or bought
from other players, and is not a common item. However, the combined punch of
damage and range on this weapon makes it worth it!
Don't Hoard Weapons
Scared of losing your weapons? Don’t be. It is better to have fought
and lost than have never fought at all, and weapons can fairly easily be
remade! Going out to fight with your weapons is a great way to get experience
in the game, learn the mechanics of each gun, and build up your confidence in
your abilities! 
Collect Cards
The puzzles at the outpost have some tasty loot, and the keycards for
them are fairly easy to find! If you’ve played Skyrim (which you should, if you
haven’t,) you’ll easily understand the mechanics of the puzzles, which combine
tiered keycards with fuse boxes to open doors. Behind the third, best tier of
doors, you’ll find everything you could ever need-- guns, rad suits for
protection at the monuments, components, and in some cases, armour and
medicine! 
Collect Wood
Wood is essential! You'll need wood to build a base, craft simple
weapons and once you reach higher tiers of equipment, you'll need wood to cook
sulfur, metal fragments and high-quality metal. Wood will always be used, whether
you're building a wood two by two or you're cooking sulfur to go on a C4 raid,
you will always need wood.
Keep Up with Upkeep
Upkeep is a somewhat new mechanic that the devs at Facepunch
introduced. In a simple way, it’s kind of like rent you have to pay, but
instead of cash, you pay with the resources your base if made out of, if you
have wood walls, floors, foundations or etc, you’re upkeep will be based off
how many you have, if you upgrade to stone, you will now be required to pay a
stone upkeep. Farming up to pay your upkeep makes sure your base doesn’t decay
and wither away and it’s always a good idea to have enough upkeep to last you
until the next time you log on to keep your base at it’s best.
Skins = Wins, Kinda?
This is a highly debated topic in a majority of games, but in Rust,
skins actually have a use. In combat scenarios, it’s easier to identify who’s a
foe and who’s a friend or ally with skins. Skins are a nice way to support skin
creators and the devs back at Facepunch. If you would like to customize your
base or your loadout this is most likely a skin out there for your liking. But
don’t worry if you have concerns with this almost pay to win system, the devs
are in the works on a team system that replaces the need of uniforms for the
most part.
Modded Experience
There are two main types of servers you will find on Rust in its
current state-- modded and vanilla. Vanilla servers can be found under official
and community under the servers section and modded have their own section. Modded
servers introduce more control to the admins of the server allowing them to
change features part of rust such as the gather rate, respawn locations and
etc. Modded servers can be a great place for a new player to start up their
endeavors in Rust due to a majority of modded survival servers giving their
players kits and higher gather rates allowing the player to learn the game
mechanics with less hassle.
Use Voice Chat
Voice chat is one of the two ways to communicate in Rust, one being in
the chat and the other in voice. Unlike chat where your messages are
broadcasted to the whole server, voice chat is only to players in your
proximity, this can be used to trade goods with other players, trade
information, ask them to buddy up with you or discuss the crazed lunatic with
the AK-47 who killed you in your previous life for your rock and torch.
Try Befriending Your Neighbors
Picking your base location can be challenging, especially when you have
to account for your closest threat or your closest ally-- your neighbor. When
first starting Rust, the less threats to you the better, so if you can try
making friends with your neighbors, the better for you, everyone in Rust is
quite psychotic so maybe offering them resources they need to turn for
protection for when you’re first starting off may benefit you, just be careful
for how much they ask for and if you’re willing and able to make the cost. If
you’re lucky, you can persuade them for no cost if they’re friendly and
understand the challenges it can be to be new to Rust. Just be wary, for
betrayal comes from the ones closest to us.
Run!
In your beginning days of Rust, try not resorting to player vs player
scenarios. When you hear gunshots in the near distance, you should run to your
nearest safe location, whether this is in the opposite direction of the
gunshots or into your base, you’re going to want to avoid combat. Don’t take
this wrong and play Rust completely avoiding combat your entire playthrough,
but for your beginner days you’re going to want to avoid combat until you have
a good sense of how the game works, then after, you’re going to want to engage
in combat to better your skill. 
Farming Minigames
When gathering wood from trees or stone, sulfur or metal from nodes, a
minigame will appear. For trees a red “X” will appear on the tree after your
first hit, after the “X” appears if you hit it, your gather rate increase
slightly and you will begin gathering more and more each hit on an “X’ until
you reach the cap gather rate of the tool you’re using. This will help you farm
faster making farming quicking and reducing the time you’re left vulnerable to
other players.
 
Having Multiple Sleeping Bags
If you can having multiple sleeping bags can come to a good use. If you
have two in your base and you happen to be raided and they don’t reach your
second bag, you won’t have to venture back out to your base to salvage what’s
left, or if you die during the raid and they destroy your first bag, you can
spawn on the second and try again to fend off the attackers. If you’re far from
home, it’s safe to place a sleeping back in the vicinity of the area you’re
around just in case you die, when we all first started out that one wolf or
bear that killed us and made us lose all our loot because we were to far away
from base to get back in time before another player loots our dead body could
be avoided if we placed a bag closed to where we were. This bag would give us
better control on where can spawn on the map. Also, if we’re to go out raiding
or going out on a fight, having a bag near the battle or raid could grant us a
faster time of returning and possible fighting for a second time if out loot
wasn’t taken or maybe you could get loot from a different body to return back
into the fight as fast as possible.
Airlocks
Knowing how to build a strong base is very important. To make sure for
when you open door and you meet your demise to a shotgun having an airlock can
become extremely useful. The airlock will prevent an intruder from getting
straight into your loot and causes raiders to go through more in order to get
your loot, costing a raider more resources and giving you more time. An airlock
is as simple as having a triangle or square coming off the door of your base,
covering it with walls and loving one door way with a door. It acts as a buffer
zone between the outside and the inside, just make sure you close your doors
behind you to make sure no one can get through your base for free, even with an
airlock it’s dangerous to leave doors open.
Safe and Secure Key Locks
There’s two types of locks in rocks a simple key lock and a code lock.
A key lock requires a key to open so if someone else was to get access to the
key, they could open your door and take all your goodies, with a new update the
person who crafted the first key to the lock doesn’t need a key, so after
crafting a key lock and crafting a key, throwing away the key and letting it
despawn in your base will let you have a door that only you can access, but
with friends this can bring up an issue with getting in and out of the base, so
if you’re planning of playing with friends we suggest getting to a code lock as
fast as possible. Just remember to always make sure your locks are locked and
not unlocked. For code locks you have to cook metal and craft one with 100 metal
fragments, after placing it on a door you can put in a four number pin, this
pin number shouldn’t be told to anyone accept people you’re going to base with.
Do not right this down any where in Rust, access to this code to an
untrustworthy player can mean an end to your base.
Eat Up, Buttercup
Before venturing out, you’ll have to tend to your basic needs in Rust,
hunger and thirst. Water is quite easy to access as long as you’re near a clean
water source that isn’t salt water, this will mostly be rivers or small bodies
of shallow water that aren’t connected to the ocean. While we’re on the topic
of rivers, they supply food from the crops that grow near the river naturally,
you’ll find pumpkins and corn in large quantity as long as no one else has
taken from the river, the food near the river will with no doubt supply you
with enough food to go a long while without having to harvest anymore. After
picking a spawned crop we get a seed and for eating a crop we get more seeds,
these seeds can be used to grow more crops to keep a supply of food. Another
way to find food is small baskets of food found near monuments in small
monuments such as the supermarket. Monuments are the marked places on your map
you can see by hitting the default key “G” and going to these monuments can
help the player gain resources other than food. Another way to get food is by
crafting fishing traps, these traps are very simple and cost cloth and wood.
After crafting the trap, we have to place it near a body of water. By putting
any food besides canned food into the trap you have a chance to catch minnows
or a trout. Trout can be cut apart and provide raw fish, bones and animal fat.
Minnows on the other hand are smaller and grant less food than trouts but come
in larger quantity than trout. Sadly, in the current state of Rust, minnows
can’t be used as bait to catch trout. Another way to get food is by hunting, on
the island of Rust, we can find bears, wolfs, horses and deers. All of these
grant a food correlating to the animal, hide or cloth, bones, low animal fat
and only for the wolf, you can get a wolf skull to craft a wolf headdress. And
a more cruel and looked down upon way of getting food in Rust in cannibalism,
if you are to kill a player you can chop them up for food, bones and animal
fat. Cooking this food will allow you to eat a fellow player, but eating human
meat cost thirty hydration, so make sure if youre last choice is to eat human
meat, is you have water on the side to quench your thirst. Cooking these meats
or putting them in fish traps can be used to feed the player and grant a small
amount of hydration. Another way to get water to by wells spawned around the
map, the wells supply water, but in turn cost a little of your calories or in
simpler way to understand takes a little bit out of your hunger to pump the
well. Stocking up on food and bottles of water is a good way to make sure you
don’t die to natural cause.
Understanding Monuments
Monuments are locations spawned around the map, they come in tiers 1-3.
One being the lowest tier and 3 being the highest. In lower tiers, you’ll
common loot. In higher tier monuments you have a higher chances to find more
rare and more sought after materials. When first spawning off, you’ll spawn
around tier 1 monuments and depending where you go to on the map and where you
end of basing will determine your access to the resources found in these
monuments. Each monument has a unique style to it and some have challenges that
come along, some have key card locks and fuses and some have challenging
parkour to reach a reward.
Hide Your Base
Building your base in an unpopular location may be useful for
newcomers-- avoiding populated areas full of combat is a safe way to build your
base and avoid being raided. Some nice spots to hide your base is in caves in
the designed plots, side of some cliffs, areas that are far from hotspots such
as monuments, and other low profile areas. 
Find Your Spawn
When spawning it, maybe you want to be in a different area, maybe the
spawn you have seems to be filled with players, looted or is on the wrong side
of the map you want to be on, by hitting “F1” you can open up the console-- by
typing kill, you character will die and you can try again to spawn somewhere
else. Just a heads up, though, there’s a cooldown of one minute on the command.
Be Sneaky Beaky
Crouching is a perfect way to add a layer of security to your roaming.
You don’t have footsteps for others to hear, and can get closer to animals and
other players without them being aware!
High External Protection
High external walls are great to have on your person late-game! If
you’re getting shot at, all you have to do is pop up a wall between you and
your attacker! With wood high-externals costing only 300 wood, there is no
reason that you shouldn’t have these with you if you are running with expensive
guns and armor! 
Be Sure to Log Out Safely
When logging out, make sure to log out in a safe area, inside your base
is best, and no this doesn’t mean inside your front door, try sleeping in the
most secured area in your base to increase your chances of waking alive and
untouched. 
Come Prepared To Raid
Raiding is a very expensive and challenging part of Rust, this comes in
many forms of raiding, whether you’re using a flamethrower to burnt through a
wooden surface or wooden door, using satchels, C4, explosive 5.56 ammo or maybe
a rocket launcher to tell your target how you truly feel about them. Or maybe
they made a mistake building and you’re able to pickaxe one of their walls down
or maybe they have one door and you are going to go deep into their loot room. 
Making sure you have enough resources to get through with a raid to
important, make sure to have enough ammo, medical supplies, strong enough armor
and good guns. Having these doesn’t guarantee a raid, it’s the skill behind
these that make it successful or not, so with practice you can up your chances.
Be aware and don’t get tunneled vision, players around the map will
hear the raid if you’re using satchels, C4 or rockets and if you’re using
explosive 5.56, try you best to have a suppressor on. And just because you’re
raiding using a quite technique doesn’t mean you’re safe, roaming players or
allies of the your target could come and ruin the raid and the people inside
the base, if online, can be another hassle to get over.4
Radiation Treatment
When going through some monuments, you’ll encounter radiation, this can
come in low doses based on your position of if you go to deep, you can be given
deadly doses of radiation. Now, how de we prevent this radiation? By wearing
clothing we up our radiation protection, this allows us to go deeper to get
loot in some monuments with high raditions. Or we can get a radiation suit out
of a crate randomly or off a player, which gives the best protection against
radiation and only has an issue in some spots in tier 3 monuments. If we have
rads and want to remove them instantly, we can radiation pills which will
remove a decent amount of radiation we have built up for the cost of some of
our hydration.
Zig-Zag
Dodging and weaving are the best ways to avoid being hit by bullets,
eaten by wolves, killed by bears,or being smacked by players with spears.
Running randomly is a great way to keep yourself as safe as possible in the
wild wild world of rust
Waterpipe OP
The waterpipe, which is a simple, easy to make and use shotgun, is
easily one of the most frustrating ways to die, but one of the best ways to get
tools off of other players. Hiding around a corner with a waterpipe is a sneaky
way to get loot, and quick! OEarly Morning Trappin
Looking to get an edge up on your competition and don’t mind waking up
early? Try getting up early to get online when the server population is at its
lowest! Generally, 6 a.m seems to be the sweet spot. Without other players
around, you are free to roam, farm, or go for airdrops with limited
interference!
 
Lock Your Tool Cupboard
Locking your tool cupboard is very strong way to secure your base, it
will cost your raiders more resources to get control to building access to your
base, and if they don’t have enough to break it, locking it can possible keep
the materials in your base safe and giving you building permissions to rebuild
your base. This is important early game if someone is to get deep into your
base so they can’t take it over or greif your base. 
 
Ladders Are Important Raid and
Build Tools
You can get into and out of tight spots with a ladder! Ladders are an
easy way to make a raid safer, easier, and more efficient, or climb up to a
loft in your base!
 
Safe Houses
If you have resources to spare, placing small bases, equipped with
sleeping bags and tools, are a great way to stop you from losing everything in
one raid, as well as keep yourself safer when out roaming. Small one-by-one
bases, especially those with airlocks, are great for this. se9. 
Pick Up Resources When Running
Around 
Each small stone, tree stump, or hemp plant can add up. If you are out
farming, roaming, or even raiding, make it a habit to pick up these small
resources, as they can be extremely helpful later on (and also in the early
game!)
Keep Kits on Hand
In the event of a raid, lost gunfight, or death by radiation, bears, or
wolves, you’ll want to be able to head back out there to retrieve any lost
items. By keeping a spare set of clothes, armour, and a gun or two somewhere
safe in your base, you can reduce the amount of time you have to spend grinding
between each death!
