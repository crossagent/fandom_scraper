# Location

Destructible Roadsigns can be found naturally spawned next to roads, and are quite abundant. They also spawn in groups at the Outpost.
 
All Destructible Roadsigns have 100 health, and always drop 1 Metal pipe and 1 Roadsign upon destruction.
# Trivia

Road Signs existed before the November 5th update, however they were not destructible.
# Tips

At the beginning of a wipe, it may be a viable strategy to farm Destructible Roadsigns at Outpost, as you'll only need to break 10 in order to afford a Double Barrel or Revolver from the Weapons Vending Machine.
