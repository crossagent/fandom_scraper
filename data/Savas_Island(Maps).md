# Alterations

The Savas Island map is very different from regular Rust gameplay. You can't build in most places, the map is fairly small, and loot spawns have been tweaked to mostly give combat-related items. All the radtowns are specialized in some way, like the Savas Island-exclusive Ammo Shack, a town devoted to special ammo drops, a C4 shack, and other unique buildings.
 
Players spawn on the lower beaches of the map, and work their way up to the "king-of-the-hill" radtown atop the mountain in the north. This radtown provides the best, highest grade loot and is intended to be the focus of the map.
On most of the map, building is not possible. However, there is a single hill in the middle of the map on which building is permitted. On this hill, there are static spotlights to aid the inhabitants with defence.
Throughout the map, there are several public Camp Fires, a public Large Furnace, and other ordinances to help the players survive.
The loot in the map is clearly tiered, as all the loot boxes are specifically marked to show their quality. Ammo crates have their own model. Airdrops in the map are more frequent than in normal Rust. Hemp spawns are also much higher.
