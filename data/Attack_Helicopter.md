# Destroying The Helicopter

It is possible to destroy and loot helicopters, though this often proves quite challenging.
Spraying weapon fire at the helicopter is never practical. Certain weak spots, such as the main rotor, and tail rotor, must be targeted in order to effectively deal damage to the helicopter. It has a total of 10000 health and goes down to 2500 once a rotor has been destroyed. If you destroy both rotors it will fall out of the sky. The helicopter shoots in bursts so take cover during the burst and fire shots when it has finished there are 3 seconds between each burst. If you shoot the rotors, a small trail of smoke will begin to emerge from them, which starts at light grey color and gets darker as it takes more damage. After taking sufficient damage, the helicopter will start spinning mid-air, plummet diagonally out of the sky with a fiery trail, and crash. It will leave a wreckage of helicopter fuselage and loot crates. The entire wreckage will be engulfed in a fuel fire.

 Rust Beginner's Guide - How To Take Down The Patrol Helicopter 
Here's a guide video that shows you the best way of taking down the helicopter. It also shows a base design, the best weapon, the attack helicopter's attacks, its loot and its resource yield when salvaging and many other things.
# Looting the helicopter

 
The wreckage will be engulfed in the fuel fire, which is bright and visible from far away (watch your back!). Smoke plumes and four burning loot crates will lay scattered out in the wreckage. You will be unable to loot any of the crates until the fire ceases, which lasts a few minutes. As of Devblog 194 players can no longer build within a small radius of the crash site. The loot is generally very rewarding and can contain weapon mods, plenty of special ammunition and other treasures.
You are also able to harvest the downed helicopter with a pickaxe or similar tool. The helicopter itself breaks into several pieces that you are able to harvest like nodes (using a gathering tool). They contain High Quality Metal, Metal Fragments and Charcoal when harvested.
The loot crates may contain (rarity increasing throughout the table):

# Avoiding the helicopter

If you don't want to fight the helicopter, or just want to get away safely without dying, here's how to effectively avoid the helicopter.
If you can, avoid monuments and points of interest.
In order to avoid almost any conflict with the helicopter, make sure that you do not have any ranged weapons on your toolbar. In addition, you should not have more than two (2) items of clothing on your person. Having both clothing and ranged weapons in your inventory is fine.
Don't go too close to where the helicopter is flying. Once it locks onto you, it is very hard to outrun the helicopter, as it will not relent until you have been killed.
The helicopter will not de-aggro while it has a continuous line-of-sight: It will not stop trying to kill you if you unequip items listed above while it can see you. It has been observed by some players to see and chase a target (who has 2+ clothing items/ranged weapon(s) in their hotbar), lose & re-establish it's line-of-sight, then approach, but not fire and ultimately lose interest in its target.Stay low, or close to rocks and other obstructions. The helicopter is unlikely to target someone it cannot see.
You might be able to hide in a sturdy, strong, large building. However, the helicopter can still be alerted to your presence if there are windows or open doors, and heavily damage the building with its gunfire.
# At night

If an Attack Helicopter shows up at night, it may be easier or harder to avoid/fight it. There are a few notable changes to the helicopter at night:
The Attack Helicopter has a spotlight that will shine around as though looking for targets. However it does not define the sight of the Attack Helicopter and it will open fire even if you're not in the beam.
The Attack Helicopter will NOT be lit up, and the spotlight shining in the dark sky is the only effective way to spot the attack helicopter coming.

# Trivia

The Attack Helicopter model is based on the real-life Bell UH-1Y Venom .
The Attack Helicopter has 3 types of weapons: twin burst-fire machine guns (presumably M249's), a rocket launcher, and a napalm launcher. Learning how to avoid getting killed by any and all of these armaments are rather difficult, but an effective tactic is fighting the helicopter in a large group, spread out across a large area.
Looting the Attack Helicopter's or Bradley APC tank's crash site are the only ways players can get the M249, a powerful light machine gun.
The Attack Helicopter has two health bars: one on the tail rotor, and one on the main rotor.
The main rotor is about (on an un-modded server) 750 HP. The tail rotor, again on an un-modded server, 375 HP.
If you take out the tail rotor it will not cause the helicopter to go down. (It will decrease the turning capabilities)
The main rotor is the only mandatory rotor you destroy. You won't have to destroy anything else on the helicopter for it to go down.
NOTES:
Helicopter now doesn't use the main rockets that damage buildings if the player it is targeting is in a building blocked zone; you can no longer raid bases using solely the Attack Helicopter.
It still uses incendiary/napalm rockets in building blocked zones still as well as it's primary gun fire.
