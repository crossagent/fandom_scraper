# Placement

The drop box can be placed into any solid wall as long as there is some free space on both sides of the wall. Therefore, a drop box doesn't create a weak spot in your base. 
This item has two different sides, the frontside, which should face outside , and the backside, which looks like a vault. 
The backside sticks out quite a bit from the wall, and can therefore be used as stairs as well. For the frontside, the same is theoretically possible, but quite difficult.
Once placed, the Drop Box can neither be turned nor picked up again!
## Raiding

While the drop box itself doesn't create a weak spot, depending on its placement it might reveal a weak spot. Since to take out the loot out of the drop box, the backside has to be accessible, this for usual means that blowing up the wall a drop box is placed on will reveal an alternative entry point into the base.
One way to avoid this is placing drop boxes into honeycombs, and placing a window in the side of the honeycomb facing inside (Windows can be picked up again with a Hammer. The only window one can not shoot through is the Reinforced Glass Window). 
In a reverse manner, a drop box can also be used to fake a weak point in your base, luring raiders into wasting explosives on a non-advantageous spot.
# Operation principle

The backside of the Drop Box functions just like a small chest - it has 4 rows of item space, which can be freely put in or out.
The frontside of the Drop Box features a single item slot as well as a button. When an item is placed into the slot, the backside has at least one free item slot, and the button is pressed, the item is transferred into the backside storage.
## Efficient operation

Since a player who wants to send items into his base is for usual on the outside, it's key to be as fast as possible when transferring the loot.
One trick to speeding up the process is to use the 'Hover Loot' key (standard key 'H'). 
Use this key while hovering quickly over a row, and then instantly spam the send button. 
If you're fast enough, this technique allows you to transfer one row at a time, just as fast as when using a regular chest.
# Usage

The obvious use of this item is to transfer loot from the outside of your base into the inside, without having to enter the base. This is especially helpful for extremely small bases, as they for usual come with the risk that if you get shot at the wrong time, the door is left open and the enemy can just walk into your base.
Besides this, there are many more use-cases:
Drop Boxes can be used to fit even more chests into small spaces (this is risky though, as they can be destroyed from the outside).
Drop Boxes can be used as compact stairs (only the backside).
A peculiar use case of drop boxes is to create no-door-bases. Such bases for usual have a core that can only be entered by respawning into it. This allows one to avoid any weak spot like doors or windows.
In case of an online raid, one can use a drop box to stash away your loot into a honeycomb. Even if the raiders guess that you did that, they'll either have to blow up the wall to get the loot, or destroy the drop box to make no one get the loot.
Once the raid is over, one then just has to wait till the outer wall of the honeycomb decays to get the loot back (be aware that this might take a lot of time).
