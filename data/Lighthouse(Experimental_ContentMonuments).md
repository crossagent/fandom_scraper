# Layout

The Lighthouse is a tower-like structure, usually located in coastal areas and along shorelines.
It has a single unlocked entrance at the bottom.
Leading all the way up to lantern room at the very top is a spiral staircase.
# Infrastructure

The Lighthouse provides access to a Recycler.
# Loot

The Lighthouse is mainly populated with regular loot Barrels, although some Basic Crates can spawn inside.
At the very top of the lighthouse opposite the ladder is a Supply Crate that cannot be seen on the way up the ladder so look for that.
The Lighthouse provides no Military Crates so it's a less desirable Monument.

# Trivia

It was possible for players to build their own structures on and around the Lighthouse some time ago, as the monument didn't use to incur a "Building Blocked" penalty. However, this has since been fixed.
