# General Information

The Cargo ship, also known as the "CCSC Lazarus" is mobile Monument that only spawns periodically.
 
When it spawns, it circles the map a few times, then leaves the area. There is no Radiation on the Cargo Ship while it is circling the map, but when it leaves, the Radiation poisoning quickly demolishes your health. The Cargo Ship is inhabited by Scientists and often other hostile players, so its not recommended for starting players to attempt to board the ship.
