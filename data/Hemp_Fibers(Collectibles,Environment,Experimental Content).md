{'title': 'Hemp Fibers', 'content': 'Naturally grown Hemp plants can be usually found in forests, or near them, and in most deserts. Hemp Fibers can be harvested from Hemp plants; the wild kind are commonly found on all Maps in Experimental Rust. They can be harvested by targeting the Hemp plant and pressing the Use key(default "E"). A harvested plant yields 10 Cloth and 1 Hemp Seed , which can be then used to cultivate new plants in the future. \nHolding down the Use key on Hemp plants grown from seed will give you the option of taking a cutting from a plant, yielding a Hemp Clone to plant where you choose.\nHemp Fibers are currently one of three species, the others being Corn and Pumpkin (both edible), used for Crafting.'}
