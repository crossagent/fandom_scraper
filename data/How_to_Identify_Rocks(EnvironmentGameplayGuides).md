# Identification of Mineral Node Types

Stone Node: These Nodes spawn primarily in Grassy biomes. These rocks are a constant shade of grey, and no other color. (After the Blueprints 3.0 update, they can frequently spawn as red-tinted nodes in desert biomes).
Metal Node: This type of rock appears primarily in Snow biomes, faint reddish-brown splotches are visible on the rock.
Sulfur Node: This Node usually appears in Desert biomes. Easy to distinguish from the other types of rocks because they have highly visible splotches and streaks of yellow.
