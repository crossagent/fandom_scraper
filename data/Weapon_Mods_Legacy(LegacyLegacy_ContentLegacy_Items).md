# Flashlight Mod

This article has a Experimental counterpart. Click here to go to the article.
The Flashlight Mod was an attachment that added a flashlight to a player's Firearm. The Flashlight was an effective light source and was especially useful in tight, dark areas where a Torch would render the player defenceless.
## Usage


### Usage

The Flashlight Mod could be placed onto a firearm by dragging the attachment onto any firearm which had a free attachment slot. 
Players could toggle their flashlight on and off by using the "F" key.
Note: Some firearms did not support attachments. 
### Firearms

Below is a list of firearms that mods can be attached to:
9mm Pistol
Bolt Action Rifle
M4
MP5A4
P250
Revolver
Shotgun
### Obtaining

Flashlight mods could be obtained in three different ways:
By crafting them;
Finding them in Loot Crates;
Looting Rad Animals.
### Crafting

Flashlight mods could be crafted using 5 Low Quality Metal. Doing so would take 7 seconds and yielded one flashlight mod. A Workbench was required to craft them.
### Trivia

The Flashlight Mod could sometimes become stuck in the "on" state for other players, effectively making players an easy target, or alerting other players when someone was trying to be stealthy. This could be fixed by dying, or logging out and rejoining the game.
The Flash Light Mod (like the Laser Sight), pointed sideways when attached to the Revolver.
# Holo Sight

The Holo sight was an attachment that enhanced the ranged accuracy of a player's Firearm. However, if a player was not familiar with using the sight, then it could actually reduce their accuracy. 
It was possibly the most useful attachment for a weapon, and was typically used the most compared to all other attachments.

### Crafting

Holo sights could be crafted using 5 Low Quality Metal. Doing so would take 7 seconds and yielded one Holo sight. A Workbench was required to them.
# Notes

The Holo sight was incorrectly spelled with a lower case 's' in-game.
The experimental version is called the 'Holosight'.
The real life version is called a 'holographic weapon sight' or 'holographic diffraction sight'.
# Laser Sight

This article has a Experimental counterpart. Click here to go to the article.
The Laser Sight was an attachment that enhanced the ranged accuracy of a player's Firearm. The laser allowed the user to see the exact point of aim when firing from the hip and while aiming. The laser dot was visible to everyone. Along with a slight increase in accuracy, the user could use the laser sight to pre-aim from the hip before aiming down the sight to facilitate faster target acquisition.
## Usage


### Usage

Players could toggle their laser sight on and off by using the "G" key.
Note: Some firearms did not support attachments.
### Firearms

Below is a list of firearms that mods can be attached to:
9mm Pistol
Bolt Action Rifle
M4
MP5A4
P250
Revolver
Shotgun
### Obtaining

Laser Sights could be obtained in two different ways:
By crafting them;
Finding them in Loot Crates.
### Crafting

Laser Sights could be crafted using 5 Low Quality Metal. Doing so would take 7 seconds and yielded one Laser Sight. A Workbench was required to craft them.
### Trivia

When the Laser Sight was attached to the M4, the laser's point of aim was above the actual aim point.
The Laser Sight didn't work correctly on the Bolt Action Rifle. It pointed off to the left, and actually hindered use.
The Laser Sight on the Revolver pointed off to the right, effectively rendering it useless.
# Silencer

The Silencer was an attachment that reduced the sound, range and muzzle flash of a player's Firearm. The Silencer did not completely eliminate gunfire noise, but they did reduce it significantly, therefore making it impossible to hear from a long distance. The Silencer also eliminated muzzle flash, therefore making it difficult for player's to tell if a gun had been fired, especially in darkness.
Note: The silencer incurred a range penalty when used.
