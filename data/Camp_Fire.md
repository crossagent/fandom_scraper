# Crafting

Campfires may be crafted with:
100 Wood
They take 30 seconds to craft.
Once a campfire is crafted, it may be placed on any appropriate (green) surface by the player by clicking the left mouse button.
# Trivia

You can only cook food or smelt empty Tuna Cans and Bean Cans to Metal Fragments in a campfire. A campfire will only use three wood to smelt Cans; a Furnace will require 15 wood.
You can cook up to 4 pieces of food simultaneously.
A campfire can be crafted with 100 wood, but only spawns in the world with 50 wood in its inventory, making free campfires no longer viable.
