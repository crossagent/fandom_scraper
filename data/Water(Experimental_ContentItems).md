# How to Get

Water is obtained from Water Catchers in the form of precipitation or condensation. Once Water accumulates in a Water Catcher, a player can then collect the Water inside, as long as they have a container to store it in (such as a Bota Bag, Water_Jug or Small Water Bottle). They can also drink Water directly from the Water Catcher or a river. Drinking water will heal the player only up to 60 health. 
# Trivia

Small Water Bottles do quench a player's thirst. You can store Water manually in one, or transfer back out using the Water Catchers or the Water Barrel. Water bottles can hold 250 ml.
The Nutrition section claims that Water reduces Radiation and Poisoning. We can infer that this means if you are irradiated or poisoned, drinking Water will alleviate a small amount of the Status Effect.
Water used to be able to be dropped on the ground via some means which resulted in a default bag item with the name 'Water' and was unable to be picked up.
However sometimes drinking the water can cause you to suffocate.
