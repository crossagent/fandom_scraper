Once obtained and researched, the Timer can be crafted when in AoE of a Workbench Level 1 using 5 High Quality Metal and 1 Gear.
# Usage

The Timer has 3 spots for wiring: the input, the output and a "Toggle On" part. When "Toggle On" receives power, it will turn on the Timer.
It will output 1 less rWm than the input power.
# Durability

It has a maximum of 200HP. It can be picked up with a Hammer, but it will lose HP when doing this. 
It can also be repaired with the Hammer using HQM when placed. It can also be repaired in a Repair Bench using half the amount of HQM and Metal Fragments, but it will lose 20% of its maximum HP and the player needs to have its Blueprint learnt.
