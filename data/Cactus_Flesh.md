# Crafting

The Cactus Flesh cannot be crafted, but can be obtained by harvesting cacti plants. Note that not all cacti can be harvested, as some are purely decorative.
Cactus Flesh can be harvest with a Pick Axe or Hatchet, but be careful not to go too close as its sharp thorns will damage you and can inflict a small amount of bleeding as well.
