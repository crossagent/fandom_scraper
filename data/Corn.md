# Obtaining

The reliable way to obtain Corn is to find and harvest a corn plant. You can find them near rivers, from time to time in the world or plant a corn plant with Corn Seeds which you receive by looting a Corn Plant or by eating Corn. Dark brownish green Corn plants that have not been watered will yield only 2 Corn. Adding Water to a plant keeps it a healthy green and increases the yield to as much as 6 Corn. Clicking "use" on any cultivated plant yields 2 Clones, or 6 if fully watered; in this case, Corn Clones.
