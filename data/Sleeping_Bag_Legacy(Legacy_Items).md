# Crafting

Sleeping Bags are immediately available to the Player in the Crafting Menu. (Unlike some items that require Blueprints & Research Kits to Craft)
Sleeping Bags require 15 Cloth and take 30 seconds to craft
# Usage

Unlike some Items, Sleeping Bags don't have an active usage, but a passive usage as a spawn point.
To place a Sleeping Bag move the item to your hotbar, press the selected number of the hotbar, and left-click in desired spot. If the Player dies, they can select 'At a camp' (written under "Respawn") to spawn to the last-placed Sleeping Bag.
# Life time

Sleeping Bags can still be destroyed by other players, so be sure to place it in a secure spot. It takes 25 hits to destroy the bed with a Hatchet and 20 Hits with a 9mm Pistol. 
# Trivia

Picking up the Sleeping Bag is impossible if you have spawned on it within the last 4 minutes.
