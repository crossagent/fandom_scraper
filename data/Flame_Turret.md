# Tips

It is recommended to place them around corners, so that raiders or unwanted "friends" will take the damage instead of simply seeing, and therefore avoiding it.
Do not place them in wood structures. The fireballs will set fire to the building, which will do you much more harm than good, even if it kills the raiders.
It is also recommended to put them in inescapable hallways.
It will blow up when destroyed.
Don't place in your chest room.
