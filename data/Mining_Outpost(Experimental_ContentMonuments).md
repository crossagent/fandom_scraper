# Layout

The Mining Outpost is a single-story, ground level storage facility with a slanted roof and open entrances on either side.
On the inside, one would find a forklift, a small office and wooden cargo crates stacked on both metal shelves and the floor.
# Infrastructure

The Mining Outpost offers access to a Repair Bench and Recycler that can be found inside amongst the crates.
# Loot

Generally, regular loot Barrels and Basic Crates spawn inside the Mining Outpost.
However, there is a little hut on the other end of the Mining Outpost, where you can find Military Crates.
