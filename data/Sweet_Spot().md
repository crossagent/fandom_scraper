# Information

The Sweet Spot is the most important spot of Trees and Nodes. 
When hitting this spot, you will gather more resources for that hit, therefore destroying the Tree/Node faster. Overall the player won't get more resources for hitting the Sweet Spots, but it will use less durability of mining tools.
