# Layout and Location

 
There are multiple stations across the map, represented by an icon of a bus in a white circle. Near that icon, there should be an underground entrance as shown in the picture. An elevator can be used in order to get to the bottom quicker. 
 
After the first elevator ride you will go through a place with some Sleeping Bags and furniture, its believed that the tunnel dwellers live there but you cant find any NPCs there. When you take the final elevator or stairs at the end of the sleeping bags place you will be met with the platform and the Tunnel Dweller NPCs.
In between the platforms there can be find groups of dwellers, around 3 dwellers in each group. 
 
That place looks like this picture on the left.
# Tunnel Dwellers

 
The Tunnel Dwellers (also know as underground scientists) are hostile NPCs that are located in the Train Tunnels, they are equipped with the M92 Pistol or the M39 Rifle, when you kill them they will drop Components, bullets or construction items.
The amount of tunnel dwellers in each platform are around 5. 
# Train

 
The train can be used to travel fast around in the Tunnels, as you can put low grade in the fuel storage behind the cockpit 
Driving controls
W to go forward, there are 3 modes, low medium and high.
S to go reverse and reduce the forward speed
A and D to go left and right in crossways
If you have the high mode for too long your train will overheat and it will alarm you with a beeping sound and it will show "warn" at the screen, if you dont lower your speed it quick enough your train will explode. 
You can also brake the barricades in the middle of the railway at the platforms with the train.
Tip: when you want to pass through a platform you can put your train at low forward and kill the dwellers from the train like a drive by
# Loot

In the Train Tunnel Network you can mainly find components, scrap, bullets and tools. 
There are Military Crates, Loot Crates and Tool Boxes
