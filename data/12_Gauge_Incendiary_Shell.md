# 12 Gauge Incendiary Shell

This ammo is used by shotguns and does slightly less damage than regular buckshot ammo, but creates flames upon impact causing anyone walking on it to walk more slowly and take fire damage (Does not work on animals or scientists) (Keep this in mind when using it in close range). It is often used with the Spas-12.
