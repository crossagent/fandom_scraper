# Trivia

The Crossbow is famously known for its ability to shoot arrows through walls. This is very effective when used properly.
While the Crossbow is considered an upgrade to the Hunting Bow and the Compound Bow, the slower reload time of the Crossbow can make the Hunting Bow and/or the Compound Bow more useful in certain situations where a higher rate of fire is needed.
It takes 4.783 sec to reload an arrow. Subject to change.
The Crossbow is also used for somewhat mid-game times, when one is not armed with a gun.
