## Friendlies on Servers

Some servers may have more friendlies than others. Generally, servers with more peaceful or cooperative atmospheres will have more friendlies. Servers with more hostile atmospheres and lone players tend to have more bandits. However, just because a server has more friendlies does not mean bandits are not an issue. Always exercise caution when encountering new players. If it is unclear if a player is friendly, assume they are hostile.
