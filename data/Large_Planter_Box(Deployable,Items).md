# Usage

Once the item has been crafted and placed down, seeds that are in ones hotbar can be placed inside the planter. Plants grown this way will grow twice as fast as those placed on the ground. They will also grow an additional 2x faster when a Ceiling Light is placed above the planter and turned on.
When regularly watering the plants with fresh water, the plants will yield up to twice as much resources when harvested. Salt water has the opposite effect and will eventually dry out the plants. You can water the plants by spilling the water on the planter box or using a sprinkler.
Ensure you "open" the planter and place compost in planter too.
# Plantable seeds

# Decay

Plants grown in the Large Planter Box will eventually rot away and despawn given enough time.

Time wither and rot depends on type of plant and "H" (hardiness).
