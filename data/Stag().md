# Stag

A common, docile animal found in most biomes, stags are a source of natural resources available for harvesting once they are dead. Stags are fast and agile, thus proving a challenge for freshly spawned players with poor tools or weapons. If their escape is cut off, they may turn and fight with their antlers.
