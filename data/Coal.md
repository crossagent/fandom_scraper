# Coal

â€”Information accurate as of: 904.83 Update
NOTE: This item is commonly confused with Charcoal.
Coal is a drop you get from Small Stockings and SUPER Stockings. You have a small chance of getting it, and this is a seasonal item that can only be found during the Christmas season. Coal is traditionally thought to reflect someone being naughty if it is received on Christmas day. You cannot use this as fuel.
Coal can be placed in a recycler to receive 25 Stones and 2 Crude Oil, implying that, if craftable, it would require 50 Stones and 4 Crude Oil.
