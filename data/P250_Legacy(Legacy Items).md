# Usage

The P250 does slightly more damage than the 9mm Pistol allowing it to be a 3 shot kill rather than a 4 shot (if no Armor), but at the cost of a smaller magazine capacity. This is a good weapon for accurate shooters and those who prefer a stronger side arm.
It is not preferred over the Shotgun, even though it has the same cost the shotgun is better; players also have the P250's 9mm ammo researched at the start of the game, but not the shotgun shells learnt, but you can find a research kit off a rad wolf and shotgun shells in a common crate in small rad and you already know it.
# Trivia

The P250 is based on the Sig Sauer P250, chambered in 9x19mm.
It is the highest damaging pistol in the game, if you do not include the Hand Cannon.
