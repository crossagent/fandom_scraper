# Metal Ore

Metal ore is a resource that can be obtained by mining the large rocks that spawn in the world.
## Respawn Rate

The actual specific details on what resources spawn where and how are not yet fully understood.
What is known, all resource spawn rates are linked. Meaning that if you only gather metal ore and leave all other resources be, eventually there will be no ore spawning.
# Refining Metal Ore

A furnace is used to refine ores.
This is done by adding wood or low grade fuel plus the ore to the furnace. Ignite it and the ores will slowly start to turn into metal fragments. The yield per 2 metal ore is between 3-8 metal fragments with an average of 6 metal fragments.
# Paper

Paper is a resource found in loot crates and it is craftable if researched.
It costs 100 wood to make a single piece of paper.
Paper is useless. Research Kits previously required paper, but was changed in a legacy update.
# Stones

Stones are used as a crafting material.
# Obtaining

Stones can be obtained by mining Rocks.
# Usage

Stones are needed to craft:
Furnace
Arrows
Handcrafted Shells
Workbench
Stone Hatchet
# Sulfur

You can gain sulfur by smelting Sulfur Ore in a furnace, you will obtain on average 4-8 Sulfur per ore.
# Respawn Rate

The actual specific details on what resources drop where and how are not yet fully understood.
What is known, all resource spawn rates are linked. Meaning that if you only gather metal ore and leave all other resources eventually there will be no metal ore spawning.
# Sulfur Ore

Sulfur ore is obtained by mining Mineral Rocks using a Melee Weapon. It can be refined to sulfur by putting it in a Furnace.
# Wood

Wood was one of the most common, useful and basic resources in Legacy. It could be used to craft Camp Fires, Wood Barricades, Wood Doors and many other items, as seen below. 
# Finding

Wood could be gathered in two ways:
Players could cut down Trees with the Hatchet, Stone Hatchet or your beginner Rock; doing it this way only earned them 1 Wood every hit (with Rock), or 1 Wood every few hits (with Hatchets), a very slow way to do it. Hitting a tree with a Pick Axe would give them 2 Wood instead of 1 every 2 hits.
Wood Piles contained huge amounts of easy to harvest Wood: Each wood pile yielded about ~70-100 wood. Therefore wood piles were several times more efficient compared to manually harvesting trees - tools would harvest them even faster.
# Crafting

Wood was essential to craft the following structural and essential items:
Camp Fire
Wood Shelter
Wooden Door
Wood Storage Box
Large Wood Storage
Wood Barricade
Wood Gate
Wood Gateway
Wood was also essential for crafting Wood Planks which were necessary to craft wooden structural items such as the Wood Foundation, Wood Wall, etc. 
Additionally, Wood was also used to craft Stone Hatchets, Hatchets, Torchs and many other items, as visualized in the Legacy Items category. 
Note: If the player had access to a Workbench then these crafting times were reduced by 66%. 
# Respawn Rate

Unfortunately, the actual specific details on what resources drop where and how are not fully understood. Changes and updates made to Legacy also impeded this understanding, as the drop rates and yields may have been altered over time. 
What is known, all resource spawn rates are linked. Meaning that if you only gather wood from Wood Piles and leave all other resources, then eventually there will be less (or no) Wood Piles re-spawning. However, Trees in Legacy could perhaps regenerate their wood after a certain period of time, but this is not confirmed.

# Wood Storage

The Large Wood Storage is a larger version of the Wood Storage Box and is capable of containing more items.
# Crafting

The Large Wood Storage can be crafted using 60 wood, however you must first find a Blueprint or use a Research Kit to have access to crafting this item. 
# Usage

To use the Large Wood Storage you must move the item to your hotbar and then move your mouse around until the red box becomes green (Indicating that it can be placed). 
It can also be destroyed with approximately 18 hits from a pickaxe.
# Trivia

Storage Boxes can be accessed by other players, so placing Storage Boxes inside your house is a recommended idea.
