# Obtaining


## Obtaining

The boots could be obtained in three different ways:
By crafting them yourself;
Finding them in Loot Crates;
Rarely from airdrops.
## Crafting

The boots could be crafted using 10 Cloth and 30 Metal Fragments. Doing so would take 10 seconds and yielded one pair of boots.
To learn how to craft them the player had to either obtain its corresponding Blueprint from Rad Animals or a Research Kit. When using the Research Kit method, the player had to drag the Research Kit onto the boots with one Paper in their inventory.
