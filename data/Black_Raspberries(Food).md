# Usage

Consuming a Black Raspberry will instantly restore 10 health, 20 thirst, 30 hunger and decrease the player's poisoning status by 5 points. Similar to Apples and Mushrooms, no Heal over Time(HoT) effect is applied upon ingestion.
Black Raspberries can be stacked up to a maximum of 20.
Consuming a Black Raspberry is instantaneous and incurs a relatively short cooldown between each use. This makes them quite potent in combat survival situations.
# Spawn

For the time being, Black Raspberries cannot naturally be found in the wild.
There is, however, a slight chance for Supply Air Drops to yield as much as 3 Black Raspberries at a time.
On extremely rare occasions, regular loot Barrels might also yield a single Black Raspberry.
# Trivia

Black Raspberries provide an instant health boost of 10, which makes them even better than Medical Syringes, when it comes to rapid in-combat health regeneration.
Black Raspberries are currently quite difficult to obtain.
