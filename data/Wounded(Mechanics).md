{'title': 'Wounded', 'content': "Wounded is a state in which the player is damaged to the point where they are incapacitated on the ground. When Wounded, the player can be revived by teammates. If the player was holding a tool or weapon before being wounded, it will be dropped on the ground. Depending on their food and water levels, a wounded player's health will still regenerate, but their health doesn't affect their chance of recovery. The chance of recovery (getting back up without being helped) is 20%.\n "}
