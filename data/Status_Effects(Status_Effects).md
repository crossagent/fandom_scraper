# Bleeding

 
Bleeding is a disadvantageous effect that makes the player lose health over a certain amount of time and eventually leading to death. It can be caused by various things, most commonly attacks from animals, gunshot wounds, sharp weapons, traps and sometimes after taking fall damage.
# Building Privilege & Blocked

 
Building Privilege is a beneficial effect that is granted by being authorized to a nearby Tool Cupboard. Within its reach, the privileged player is allowed to build and upgrade blocks and place deployables just as outside the effect area. Also, newly placed blocks can now also be demolished by using the Hammer for a short duration after construction. After this period, blocks will turn permanent like regularly and can only be destroyed by the common means.
 
Building Blocked is a disadvantageous effect that is applied to any player in the reach of a nearby Tool Cupboard who is not authorized to it. While under its effect, the player is almost completely restricted from building, upgrading or deploying items. A few exceptions are Twig structures and ladders.
# Too Cold & Too Hot

 
Too Cold is a disadvantageous effect that is applied as soon as a player's body temperature drops below 5°C. After that point, the player starts taking damage over time, scaling with the player's decreasing body temperature and eventually leading to death. The latter can be caused by various things, most commonly:
the night,
swimming in water (see also the Wet effect)
the Winter Biome
When the body temperature drops below -4°C, an icy effect will develop around the edges of the screen.
 
Too Hot is a disadvantageous effect that is applied as soon as a player's body temperature rises above 40°C. After that point, the player starts taking damage over time, scaling with the player's increasing body temperature and eventually leading to death. The latter can be caused by various things, most commonly:
warming clothing
nearby heat sources like a Camp Fire or a Barbeque. (However not Furnaces!)
the Arid Biome
# Comfort

 
Comfort is a beneficial effect that is applied whenever the player is close to comfortable items. While under its effect, the player regenerates health (more quickly), Hunger is depleted significantly slower and Radiation Poisoning has less effect. The amount of comfort is determined by the Comfort providing item and the amount of players nearby.
Items providing comfort are for example:
Camp Fire
Barbeque
Furnace
Large Furnace
Rug
Rug Bear Skin
Chair
Table
Pookie Bear
# Starvation & Dehydration

 
Starvation is a disadvantageous effect that is applied whenever the player's hunger bar drops below 40. While under its effect, the player slowly loses health and eventually dies. Starvation can only be prevented by eating.
 
Dehydration is a disadvantageous effect that is applied whenever the player's thirst bar drops below 25. While under its effect, the player slowly loses health and eventually dies. Dehydration can only be prevented by drinking water or eating food that gives hydration.
# Poison

Poison is a disadvantageous effect that is applied whenever the player consumes raw or spoiled food. While under its effect, the player loses health and eventually dies. There are various means of stopping poison, including:
Bandages
Medical Syringes
Large Medkits
Note: The Poison effect does not display as status bar!
# Radiation Poisoning

Main Article: Radiation
 
Radiation Poisoning is a disadvantageous effect that is applied whenever the player enters an irradiated zone, mostly near Monuments. While under its effect, the player's screen will start to get fuzzy, a Geiger Counter's clicking sound will play (intensity depending on the effect's intensity) and the player will lose health and eventually die. Radiation Poisoning can be prevented by various means, most commonly including:
Radiation-resistant clothing
Anti-Radiation Pills
Medical Syringes
Water
# Wet & Drowning

 
Wet is a neutral effect that is applied whenever the player comes in contact with bodies of water. Depending on how deep the body of the player is submerged in water, the wetness bar will rise, causing the player's body temperature to drop. This can be beneficial if the player is too hot, or disadvantageous if the player is too cold. When leaving water, the player usually dries on their own, the speed scaling with the body temperature. Note that being close to the Cold effect will prevent the character from drying.
 
Drowning is a disadvantageous effect that is applied whenever the player fully submerges into water and their wetness reaches 100. While under its effect, the player quickly loses health and eventually dies.
# Wounded

Wounded is a neutral effect that is applied whenever the player is mortally wounded. Sometimes, instead of dying, the player is wounded instead, leaving them defenselessly on the ground with 5 HP. While wounded, the player either slowly regenerates or keeps losing health, depending on the circumstances. If the player reaches 0 HP, be it an animal or player finishing them off, or another status effect slowly decreasing their health, they will die. However, there is also the possibility of another player helping them up, or the player getting up again on their own - the latter being much smaller than dying.
# Trivia

Although the Furnace is a comforting heat source, it does not increase the body's temperature when nearby.
The Injured effect has been removed in Experimental Rust.
Sometimes effects are applied, even if their corresponding in-game bar is not showing up. That is usually the case when the effect is still in its beginning stage.
While wounded, the player will drop their active hot bar item as if they died.
