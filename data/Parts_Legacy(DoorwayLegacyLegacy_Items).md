## Doorway

# Crafting

It took 10 seconds to craft a Wood Doorway.
# Usage

When placing a Wood Doorway, the green highlight would clearly show a diagonal plank near the bottom on one side of the doorway. The hinge of any door placed inside the Wood Doorway would be on that side. This was helpful to know when placing the doorway in front of a staircase as this prevented the door from obstructing the stairs when opened.
## Foundation

Wood Foundations are craftable, placeable items. Certain structures in the game require a wood foundation to be built, as they build onto them. They are the basis of all building currently in the game. The only exceptions to this are doors and barricades. Wooden Foundations are currently not destructable.
# Crafting

Wooden Foundations may be crafted with 8 Wood Planks in the crafting menu.
# Dependent Structures

The following structures require a Wood Foundation to be placed before the item itself is placed:
Wood Pillar
Wood Wall
Wood Window
Wood Stairs
Wood Ramp
Wood Doorway
# Issues

Various players have been reporting that the Wood Foundation will break immediately upon placement despite it appearing green first during placement. This is most likely a bug. Some players reported resolving the problem by restarting the server. It is advisable to craft and test one Wood Foundation first before attempting to craft multiple ones to see if the problem exists and to avoid wasting wood.
## Pillar
