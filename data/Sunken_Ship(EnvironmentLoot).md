# Small ships

The small ships typically contain 1-4 Sunken boxes and Sunken crates. These need to be untied before looting. You can untie a crate/box by holding down the interact button (E by default).
# Large ship

The large ship is a much more valuable target, also rarer. It contains up to 7 crates/boxes.
