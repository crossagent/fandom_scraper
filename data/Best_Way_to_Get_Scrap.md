# Where Can I Find Scrap?

You can find scrap in barrels, crates, and military crates. Barrels, on average, give one to two scrap, boxes give five, and military crates give eight scrap. Elite military crates, which are found in monuments, can give up to 25 scrap! If you want to speed up the process of finding scrap, you can recycle components, which you find around the map in barrels and crates. To recycle your components, head to a monument, which is marked by name on the map. Each monument has at least one recycler, usually in a building or room that is easily accessible. If you're just starting out, the outpost is your best bet: because you cannot kill on sight, it is a safer alternative to many of the other monuments.
# What Can I Use Scrap For?

Scrap is predominantly used for researching, making blueprints, and crafting guns. To research, you can use a deployable item called a research table, which you can craft for 200 metal fragments and 75 scrap. Upon placing the research table, you can research guns, tools, and even components, giving you the ability to create them later (using scrap, of course!) Once you have an item researched, use a crafting table (in either tier one, tier two, or tier three, depending on the rarity and value of the item) to craft it.
To create a tier one workbench, you need 500 wood, 100 metal fragments, and 75 scrap. From there, each tier of crafting table requires more scrap, with a tier 3 table requiring 1,250 scrap to create.
# How To Get Scrap Fast

Need that tier two workbench or a new set of guns, ASAP? Try heading to outposts! Not only do they have crates and barrels for you to find scrap in, they also have recyclers that are easily accessible. When you are done gathering all your components and scrap, pop the components into a recycler to more than double your scrap! Since the outposts respawn every twenty minutes or so, you can find an almost infinite amount of scrap-- provided you donâ€™t die on the way there or the way back.
Finding Tech Trash is another great way to get a lot of scrap easily. Though they are a rare find, they give 20 scrap each, and you'll never find only one inside of a crate! Targeting Computers can also be recycled for tech trash, though they can be used further down the road.
