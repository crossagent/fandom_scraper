# Bed

Beds function like Sleeping Bags however, they can not be picked up after being placed.
Can be broken with a Rock, Hatchet, Pickaxe or C4.
# Crafting

The materials required to craft a Bed:
100 Metal Fragments
40 Cloth
# Camp Fire

This article has a Experimental counterpart. Click here to go to the article.
Campfires are craftable, placeable items which provide warmth, light and safety to any nearby player, providing a Comfort Bonus to slow down hunger and increase health regeneration (2 per tick instead of 1). They can be used to cook Food but cannot be used to refine ores. Campfires can cook three pieces of food simultaneously. Campfires also require Wood to burn (the campfire will consume 1 piece of Wood per minute) , which is placed inside the campfire's wood slot to be used as fuel.
If a player wishes to cook food in the campfire, they should hold 'e' or your 'use' key until you get two options that say 'Ignite' (if already ignited it will say 'Extinguish') or 'Open'. By clicking 'Open' you will open a HUD in which you can place Raw Chicken Breast and wood to cook.
In addition to their literal functionality as a source of comfort, cooking and light, campfires may be used as beacons to signal a player's location. Campfires may also attract Bandits to the location of a player, so caution should be taken when lighting one.
Campfires will disappear after a certain amount of time after not being lit, whether or not it has any items in it. To stop this from happening, you must keep the campfire lit at all times. Because of this, it is advised that players do not leave any items on a camp fire when it is not lit, as those items are at risk of being despawned. Campfires can be destroyed after being placed.
Campfires will be deleted after 2 hours without fuel.
A campfire with 250 wood will give you around 4 hours of comfort and light. Also resulting in 750 pieces of Charcoal .
NOTE: Once the Campfire has been crafted with 5 Wood, you are able to take out that same wood out of the campfire. This currently means that Campfires can technically be made out of nothing, but this is expected to change in the future.
A campfire can also be destroyed with 20 axe hits or 9 pickaxe hits.
# Crafting

Campfires may be crafted with 5 Wood. They take 20 seconds to craft.
Once a campfire is crafted, it may be placed on any appropriate (green) surface by the player by clicking the left mouse button.

# Furnace

The Furnace is a Craftable Item that can be used to smelt metals. It can be crafted from 15 Stones, 20 Wood and 10 Low Grade Fuel and takes thirty (30) seconds to Craft. Also you can obtain leather if you put some cloth in.
# Usage

The Furnace can be used after it has been Crafted and Placed, to Place the Furnace you must first craft it and move it to your Hotbar, from here you can move it around until the "Ghost Furnace" has turned Green (Indicating it can be placed) Once the Furnace has been placed it can be operated by a player (Any player can operate it, however only 1 player can use it at a time) and shows an empty 3x3 grid.
To use the Furnace a player must place Wood in it and ignite it.The furnace will burn up to two Wood and create the Smelted Version of the materials every 30 seconds. Players do not have to be near the Furnace for it to operate. A byproduct of the process is Charcoal, which you need to make Gunpowder.
Furnaces will smelt 1 Metal Ore and 1 Sulfur Ore per 1 Wood, so it is more efficient to smelt Metal and Sulfur together.
# Rates

The conversion rates for the furnace are as such per tick:
1 Cloth = 1 Leather
1 Metal Ore = 4-16 Metal Fragments
1 Sulfur Ore = 4-8 Sulfur
1 Wood = 2-5 Charcoal
# Trivia

The Furnace will not cook food.
The Furnace is destructible and takes approximately 20 hits with a hatchet to break.
Low Grade Fuel can be used instead of Wood.
A test was done to see if Low Grade Fuel is worth using over Wood using 2 Furnaces (one with Wood and another with Low Grade Fuel set off at the same time). This test was done 3 times with an increasing number of Wood and Low Grade Fuel . These are the results of that test:
After using 1 Wood to 1 Low Grade Fuel, both finished at the same time and both yielded the same amount of raw materials.
After using 5 Wood to 5 Low Grade Fuel, both finished at the same time and both yielded the same amount of raw materials.
After using 10 Wood to 10 Low Grade Fuel, both finished at the same time and both yielded the same amount of raw materials.
As a result of this, it is probably more efficient to smelt the Ores with Wood because Low Grade Fuel is harder to obtain.
# Large Spike Wall

Large Spike Walls are structure that can be placed on various terrain (no Foundations needed).
1500HP
5HP per Rock - 300 Hits

The Large Wood Storage can be crafted using 60 wood, however you must first find a Blueprint or use a Research Kit to have access to crafting this item. 
# Usage

To use the Large Wood Storage you must move the item to your hotbar and then move your mouse around until the red box becomes green (Indicating that it can be placed). 
It can also be destroyed with approximately 18 hits from a pickaxe.
# Trivia

Storage Boxes can be accessed by other players, so placing Storage Boxes inside your house is a recommended idea.
# Low Grade Fuel

Low Grade Fuel is required to craft a Furnace, Repair Bench and Explosives.
# Crafting

Crafting one Low Grade Fuel takes 2 seconds and requires 2 Animal Fat and 1 Cloth.
# Trivia

2 low grade fuel burn at a time to smelt 2 Sulfur Ores and 2 Metal Ores and turn 2 cloth into 2 leather, producing Charcoal in the process.
The maximum stack size of Low Grade Fuel is 250, as with most items.
# Low Quality Metal

Low Quality Metal was crafted from 15 Metal Fragments. It was primarily used to Weapons and Metal building parts that the player had researched.
# Metal Door

Metal Doors were a craftable item in Legacy, replaced by the Sheet Metal Door. They were primarily used to restrict the passage of unknown players into a building while allowing the creator (and other authorized players), free access. It was the second tier of doors, after Wood Doors, and was the strongest door in the game. It did not take melee damage. However, the door could be destroyed with 16 F1 Grenades, or 3 Explosive Charges (usually taking two due to Decay).
A Metal Door could be placed within a Metal or Wood Doorway.
Metal Doors required a Workbench to craft, which had a cost of 200 Metal Fragments.

# Repair Bench

Not to be confused with the Workbench.
The Repair Bench was an item used to repair broken or badly damaged Tools, Weapons and Armor. In order to craft, players needed 12 Stones, 60 Wood, 50 Metal Fragments and 6 Low Grade Fuel. After repairing an item, it's maximum condition is lowered, causing it to last shorter after each repair. An item is repaired using the same resources used to craft it. Repairing items, up to a point, is cheaper than making new items.

# Sleeping Bag

Sleeping Bags provide a respawn point for whomever placed it.
# Crafting

Sleeping Bags are immediately available to the Player in the Crafting Menu. (Unlike some items that require Blueprints & Research Kits to Craft)
Sleeping Bags require 15 Cloth and take 30 seconds to craft
# Usage

Unlike some Items, Sleeping Bags don't have an active usage, but a passive usage as a spawn point.
To place a Sleeping Bag move the item to your hotbar, press the selected number of the hotbar, and left-click in desired spot. If the Player dies, they can select 'At a camp' (written under "Respawn") to spawn to the last-placed Sleeping Bag.
# Life time

Sleeping Bags can still be destroyed by other players, so be sure to place it in a secure spot. It takes 25 hits to destroy the bed with a Hatchet and 20 Hits with a 9mm Pistol. 
# Trivia

Picking up the Sleeping Bag is impossible if you have spawned on it within the last 4 minutes. 
# Small Stash

Small Stash is a small storage unit which holds three item slots. It looks like a small sack and is very easily concealed.
Additionally, the stash is invisible until the player is close by. Therefore, it is important to remember exactly where it was placed. It will decay quite quickly unless placed on a Wood Foundation.
# Crafting

# Spike Wall

Spike Walls are structure that can be placed on various terrain (no Foundations needed).
375HP
5HP per Rock - 75 Hits
3HP per Stone Hatchet - 125 Hits
6HP per Hatchet - 62.5 Hits
15HP per Pickaxe - 25 Hits
# Crafting

To craft a Spike Wall you need 100 Wood. No blueprints are needed.
# Usage

The most common use of a spike wall, is to block people from building right beside your house. Destroying it requires either wasting explosive charges, or taking the reflected damage when hitting it with a melee weapon.
Whilst this will not completely stop people building staircases up the side of your building to breach your windows, It will act as a deterrent for people assuming an easy target.
They can be destroyed with 25 pickaxe hits or with 62.5 hatchet hits. If they are decayed, the hits would be less.
A spike wall will decay over time and can be repaired using wood on your hotbar. Equip the wood to your hotbar and use that corresponding key while facing the spike wall. Per wood it will repair the wall for 50 hp (up until its maximum). If left to decay the wall will be gone within 2–3 days.
# Tactics

Using spike walls inside your house is useful to make raiders waste explosive charges. In wooden structures, walls are usually weaker than metal doors, so raiders may decide just to blow through your walls to proceed through your base. The best way to stop this is by putting a spike wall on the opposite side of a wall; this can possibly soak up to 4-5 explosive charges for a raider to get through a wall. When on foundations or ceilings, spike walls do not decay as they're treated as part of the house. Keep in mind that you can see through walls, and that it looks odd if there's a wooden spikey thing at the other side of a metal wall.
During a raid, the best usage is to place them as blockages when the raiders are blowing through your base with explosive charges, you can hear where raiders place explosive charges, so it is incredibly useful to put a spike wall down to slow raiders down even more and possibly even make them use up all of their explosive charges!
# Torch

Torches provided light and kept you warm. Players could right-click to turn them on and off. Each player spawned with one Torch as well as one Rock and two Bandages every time they respawned. 
# Crafting

A Torch could be crafted with:
1 Wood
1 Low Grade Fuel
1 Cloth
Note: Torches were craftable by default.
# Wood Barricade

Wood Barricades are craftable, placeable items. Like Spike Barricades, Wood Barricades don't need to placed on a Wood Foundation, they can be placed anywhere on the ground.
1000HP
20HP per Rock - 50 Hits
15HP per Stone Hatchet - 67 Hits
25HP per Hatchet - 40 Hits
60HP per Pickaxe - 17 Hits
It is usually possible to climb up on one side of the Barricade, Bandits often use Wood Barricades to climb in through windows, or onto a roof.
Wood Barricades are often used to provide cover when engaging in a gun fight.
# Crafting

Wood Barricades may be crafted with 30 Wood in the crafting menu.
It takes 25 seconds to craft a Wood Barricade.
## Notes

One tactic, if you have a window, is to place one in front of the window inside. Make sure you have enough room to step in front if you wish to look out. This keeps raiders from having a clear shot too far into your house. It also cuts down on the amount of light coming out of the house at night.
# Wood Gate

With mechanics similar to a door, a gateway can be used to lockout players from a certain area. It has to be placed inside an already made gateway.
1800HP
5HP per Rock - 360 Hits
3HP per Stone Hatchet - 600 Hits
6HP per Hatchet - 300 Hits
15HP per Pickaxe - 120 Hits
# Wood Gateway

They do not need to be attached in between pillars; they are commonly found around houses as an extra layer of security.
# Crafting

To craft a Wood Gateway you need 400 Wood. No blueprints are needed.
# Wood Shelter

A Wood Shelter was a small dwelling that could be crafted using Wood. Though quick and easy to set up, it could be broken down by melee hits or Grenades. It acted much like a 1x1 house made with a Wood Foundation, but a little smaller and more easily destroyed. Unlike Wood Foundations which required placement on relatively flat ground, Wood Shelters could be placed on top of other flat surfaces such as large boulders and rocky mountaintops, therefore making them an ideal choice for new players. 
1050HP
2HP per Rock - 500 Hits
1HP per Stone Hatchet - 1000 Hits
2HP per Hatchet - 500 Hits
6HP per Pickaxe - 175 Hits
On some servers they had a lifespan of 12 hours, so players had to be cautious when storing valuable items in it for extended periods of time.
# Crafting

Wood Shelters could be crafted using 60 Wood in the Crafting menu.
# Notes

Both Wood Doors and Metal Doors could be placed on the front of Wood Shelters.
Wood Shelters did not require a Workbench to craft, therefore making them a good early game choice for players.
# Wood Storage Box

Wood Storage Boxes were craftable, placeable items that had 12 item slots for storing items. They could be placed anywhere in the world and could either be placed in player built structures, or on the ground. 
Wooden Storage Boxes were destructible, taking 20 hits with a Hatchet or 9 hits with a Pick Axe to destroy.
# Crafting

It took 30 seconds and 30 Wood to craft a Wood Storage Box. They were also a default crafting recipe.
# Notes

Because players could stand on top of them they were used as an improvised method of laddering into, and therefore raiding bases.
Initially, the Wood Storage box was given the description "No item description available".
The help text displayed above a Wood Storage Box read "Search".

# Workbench

Not to be confused with the Repair Bench. 
The Workbench was required to craft certain items, this was be indicated by a text in the crafting window. Standing in the vicinity of one will grant the "Workbench 1" buff, which decreased crafting times of all items by 66%.
