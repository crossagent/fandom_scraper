# Usage

The Laser Sight could be placed onto a firearm by dragging the attachment onto any firearm which had a free attachment slot.
Players could toggle their laser sight on and off by using the "G" key.
Note: Some firearms did not support attachments.

Below is a list of firearms that mods can be attached to:
9mm Pistol

# Obtaining

Laser Sights could be obtained in two different ways:
By crafting them;
Finding them in Loot Crates.
# Crafting

Laser Sights could be crafted using 5 Low Quality Metal. Doing so would take 7 seconds and yielded one Laser Sight. A Workbench was required to craft them.
# Trivia

When the Laser Sight was attached to the M4, the laser's point of aim was above the actual aim point.
The Laser Sight didn't work correctly on the Bolt Action Rifle. It pointed off to the left, and actually hindered use.
The Laser Sight on the Revolver pointed off to the right, effectively rendering it useless.
