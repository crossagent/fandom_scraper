# Strategies

Bears can be frustrating for new players and fresh spawns, as they are able to outrun the player and move about the map almost silently. There are, however, some simple strategies that new players can utilize to make bears less of a threat:
Carry a Building Plan with you and quickly build a foundation that you can jump onto to avoid the bear's attacks. This will give you time to heal bleeding and recover health. The bear will hang around for a while but will be unable to reach you, giving you the opportunity to kill it with a bow or wooden spear.
If you don't have a Building Plan with you, you can simply jump onto a nearby boulder that is tall enough to get you out of range of the bear's attacks. The bear will clip through the boulder, but there will usually be a part of its body exposed that you can attack as before. (this has been patched and will no longer work, bears walk on rocks!)
Swimming across larger bodies of water will cause bears to lose interest and break chase.
Running in circles can make the Bear run out of stamina and run away from the player.
If you want to kill a Bear, and only have bows, you should bring friends. However, killing the bear using guns is not much of a challenge.
