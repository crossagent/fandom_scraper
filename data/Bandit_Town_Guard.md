# Bandit Town Guard

Bandit Town Guards are guards that appear in the Bandit Camp. They work like scientists and if attacked are hostile and will kill you. They are found defending the camp casino and shops around the camp. They normally carry an Assault Rifle and armor, and can heal with Medical Syringes. They do not work like the ones in the Military Tunnel and when one is killed the timer instantly starts for them to respawn.
