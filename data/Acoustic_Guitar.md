# Default Note Binding

Overall, the guitar has a playable range of e3 (40) to f#5(66) (or e2/e4 - f#4/F#6 depending on octave standard) consisting of 27 different notes.The acoustic guitar's method of being played has been changed since a recent patch. The new method of playing the guitar is in a mobile mode, where the character is able to walk and run around, and notes can be played with mouse buttons M1 and M2, and the numpad, M1 plays an "A" note, and M2 plays a preset song consisten of chords, starting with a chord of Cec. The numpad plays notes from key number 1 to 7 (notes in order being c,d,e,f,g,A,B) and these notes can be altered by pressing "+" on the numpad by making them their sharp note, and enter on the numpad to increase the octave by one, only up until the 4 key. Numpad "+" and enter can be used simultaneously. The notes attached to corresponding keys can be changed in the control settings in the menus, but not M1 or M2.
The other method of playing the guitar is by pressing the "R" key, which turns the majority of the keys on the keyboard into assorted notes, as well as removing the numpad keys of any functionality. Once this mode is entered, the user can still look around, but is no longer able to move until exiting the mode by pressing "ESC". These key bindings can not be changed in the controls section of the menu.
## Notes in "Guitar Mode"

As of the update on August 5th, 2021, the following chart is the current layout of the notes to corresponding keys in "Guitar Mode" by pressing the "R" key while the guitar item is equipped:
Legend:
lower-case letter = middle octave
minus sign "-"= lower octave
upper-case letter= higher octave
There seems to currently be no additional keys to change octaves or notes into flats/sharps, and there are no key binding options to customize any of the key layouts in "Guitar Mode".
## MIDI control

The guitar, as well as other instruments, can be played with external midi applications, allowing one to play the instrument in a keyboard method, where corresponding keys represent keys on a keyboard. This functionality also allows one to play midi files and have the notes be represented by notes in the capable range by the equipped item.
LoopMIDI(connecting to rust) and SoundFont Midi Player(playing files and manual play) can be used in conjunction to achieve the above functionality, and can be downloaded at their respective websites.
