{'title': 'Diving Tank', 'content': 'The Diving Tank, when equipped, allows a player to breathe underwater until it runs out of oxygen. The amount of oxygen left is indicated on the icon of the Diving Tank. It has a maximum of 600 seconds worth of oxygen. \nSimilarly to the Jackhammer, once all the "durability" of the Diving Tank is gone, it can be refilled at a workbench.\nThe Diving Tank can only be found in crates. They can\'t be researched as they don\'t have a blueprint, and as such, can\'t be crafted.\nThere are no skins for the Diving Tank as of April 15th, 2020.', 'infobox': 'Diving Tank\nType\nAttire\nProtection\nBullet\n0\nMelee\n0\nMelee\n0\nExplosion\n0\nCold\n0\nBullet\n0\nEquipment Slot\nBody (Upper Layer)\nCrafting\nCraftable\nNo\nDescription\nDiving Tank'}
