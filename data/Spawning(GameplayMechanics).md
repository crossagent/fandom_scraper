# Items

You spawn in rust with a Rock and a Torch for primitive bashing and lighting respectively.
# Stats

When you spawn in rust your stats will be around 60 HP(?), 50 Hunger(?), 50 Hydration(?) which means that water is usually the first resource that a fresh spawn would look for.
# Mechanics

Spawning can be abused by the usage of Sleeping Bags when raiding to give raiders an 'extra life' in case they die in the raid.
