# Standard Barrel

 
These unmarked, rust coated Barrels are the most ubiquitous ones and can be found at every Monument, alongside Roads and at Junk Piles. They spawn with 35 Health points and contain items like 1 scrap and components ranging from Wood to other low-tier components.
# Biohazard Barrel

 
This Barrel is a blue, bio-hazard re-skin of the Standard Barrel and as such it inherits the Standard Barrel's properties, except that it has 50 Health points.
# Oil Barrel

 
Rather than containing Items, red Oil Barrels will drop a small amount of Crude Oil, and Low Grade Fuel when destroyed. Oil Barrels have 50 Health point and can be found underneath the Sphere Tank, inside the Lighthouse, in the outermost Hangar at the Airfield and at random trash piles.
Note: There is an Oil Refinery at both the Sphere Tank and Airfield, allowing for refining acquired Crude Oil on the spot.

## Trash Can

 
Trash cans were a derivative of the Standard Barrel, the only differences being the changed world model and skin, reduced Health points to 35 and lower-tiered loot tables. They were commonly found around the Sphere Tank and Airfield and acted like a strandard barrel that can drop medical supplies like apples and anti-radiation pills.
