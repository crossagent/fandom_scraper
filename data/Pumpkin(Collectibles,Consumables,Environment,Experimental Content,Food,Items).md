# Obtaining

Wild pumpkins can be found growing along riversides amongst wild Corn. Upon harvesting a wild Pumpkin plant; you will receive a Pumpkin Seed along a single pumpkin. Like Mushrooms and Corn, they can be eaten. When eaten, a single pumpkin will give you a single Pumpkin Seed, which then can be planted. Each seed will yield only one Pumpkin unless it is watered.
# Trivia

Pumpkins can be placed on the player's head and worn as headwear.
Pumpkins used to have durability when worn on the player's head. The more damage the pumpkin took, the less hunger, thirst, and health it would provide.
Pumpkins were introduced as part of a new farming system in Experimental Rust.
Pumpkins, alongside Corn, used to be able to be harvested earlier than intended. Eating said unripe corn or pumpkins would then provide the player with less hunger, thirst, and health.
Pumpkins are currently one of cultivars, the others being Corn (also edible), and Hemp Fibers, used for Crafting.
