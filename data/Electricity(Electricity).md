# Mechanics

 
To produce electricity, it is necessary to have generators that will convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Generators can come from renewable energies such as sun rays with Large Solar Panel or the wind with Wind Turbine, or with fossil energy with a Small Generator.
Once the electricity is produced, It must be stored in batteries. Several sizes exist, this ranges from small to medium to large batteries.
Electricity must be transfer from devices to devices with a Wire Tool.
# Electrical components


## Power Sources and Wiring


### Power Sources and Wiring

Power sources generate the electricity needed to power components. The Wire Tool is used to connect components together.
Wire Tool
Wind Turbine
Large Solar Panel
Small Generator
### Batteries

Batteries are used for storing generated power, which can then be discharged to power components. The larger the size of the battery, the more power it can store and the more power is can output.
Small Rechargeable Battery
Medium Rechargeable Battery
Large Rechargeable Battery
### Logic Gates and Switches

Logic gates and switches manipulate the flow of electricity through wires under certain conditions. They require power themselves to operate.
Switch
AND Switch
OR Switch
XOR Switch
RAND Switch
Timer
Splitter
Blocker
Electrical Branch
Memory Cell
Root Combiner
HBHF Sensor
Laser Detector
### Outputs

These components provide a certain effect when they receive enough power.
Audio Alarm
Igniter
Flasher Light
Siren Light
Auto Turret
SAM Site
Tesla Coil
Ceiling Light
CCTV Cameras
Most industrial components also require power to operate.
