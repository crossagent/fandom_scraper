# Notes

Currently all animals have the potential to be hostile but also some animals will be somewhat friendly. They will attack any players who are nearby as well as players who damage them with ranged weapons. All other animals will attempt to run away in a straight line from any nearby players if damaged with ranged weapons.
Recently animals used to be able to run through physical terrain such as rocks, but that was fixed.
Animals used to be able to pass through building walls; this bug was fixed
Rabbits were in Legacy Rust but were removed
