# In Legacy version

 
In Rust Legacy, Rabbits are one of the few passive animals in the game. They are a 1 hit kill (the same as a chicken). They usually drop 1 chicken breast and 1-3 cloth.
# In Experimental version

In the Experimental version of Rust, rabbits don't exist (They are not in the game as they were removed)
