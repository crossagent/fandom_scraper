# Usage


## As a Weapon

The Pickaxe is one of the most powerful melee weapons, killing unarmored human players in two hits. it can also kill a full armored player with 6-8 hits. It is a heavy weapon that deals more damage than the Hatchet, but also swings much slower. It does have a slight range advantage compared to the hatchet. It can also be used as a charging weapon, by swinging before you encounter an enemy in hitting distance, then running towards them and past them while the Pickaxe is still doing the swinging animation. If you time it right, you can hit players and animals without taking any damage yourself.
## As a Tool

The Pickaxe is much superior to the Stone Pickaxe in gathering minerals from rocks in one respect: it will gather a hypothetical amount from, roughly, two nodes where the Stone Pickaxe must mine three. However, it has the slowest swing speed, slower than the Rock, which evens up the yield over time while gathering vs the Stone Pickaxe considerably. It gathers very slightly more minerals from each Node than the Salvaged Icepick, and about 30% more than the Stone Pickaxe, but completes the job much slower than the Stone Pickaxe (27.4 seconds to Stone Pick Axe's 22.67 seconds, to Salvaged Icepick's 14 seconds). Its yield over time, countering only gathering itself, and not counting running from Node to Node, is 8% greater than the Stone Pick Axe. Repeatedly hitting trees, rocks, or fallen animals will give you their resources. The Pickaxe is the worst tool for collecting resources from fallen animals, as a hatchet (or even the starter rock!) can do better.
The Pickaxe can also be used to break down structures such as storage boxes, furnaces, sleeping bags, beds, campfires, barricades, spike walls and doors, at around twice the speed of a Stone Pickaxe.
