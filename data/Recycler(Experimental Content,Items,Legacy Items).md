# Notes

Frog Boots will not yield anything when recycled (25/07/18).
If a Water Jug containing water is recycled it's water value will reset to 0 just before it is recycled.
Non-recyclable items can be placed in the Recycler. Examples include Diving Mask, Diving Tank, Anti-Radiation Pills, Blueprints and raw materials.
The Recycler can be used as a means of trading. However, it is less secure than using a Shop Front as you are not protected while transferring items into it.
You can jump safely on top of the Recycler.
