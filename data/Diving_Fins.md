# Diving Fins

Diving Fins boost your swimming speed to 150% of normal. On land they slow your movement speed by 35%. They are useful when exploring the ocean, especially when looting Diving Sites. They give no protection against any kind of effect, and should only be used for diving.
Diving Fins can only be found in crates. They can't be researched as they don't have a blueprint, and as such, can't be crafted.
They have no skins as of April 15th, 2020
