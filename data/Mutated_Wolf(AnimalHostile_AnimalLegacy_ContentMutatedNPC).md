# Killing A Wolf

The Mutated Wolf is as fast as (or just a tiny bit slower) than a Running player so beware of this before you try to kill a wolf. 
You can kill a wolf with:
1 shot with a shotgun at point blank range. 
2 shots with a bow.
3 shots with an P250 or a M4.
4 shots with a 9mm Pistol or MP5A4.
