# Notes

Unlike Trees, wood piles would despawn once fully depleted. However, they would later respawn to allow gathering to continue.
On November 14, 2014, wood piles were officially removed from the Experimental version of Rust, but still remained in Legacy until that version was discontinued on December 08, 2016.
When explaining the decision to remove wood piles, Garry stated; "Haven’t we got enough sources of wood? I don’t think we need to explain this."
