# Destroying the APC

There are several locations where you can destroy it from. If you are using Rockets it is recommended to launch from a roof top, as roof tops offer protection from the APC simply by backing away from the after firing. When using Timed Explosive Charges, buildings are your best option, but keep in mind you will have to utilize the APC's blind spots with perfection. Run - place - run - hide.... rinse and repeat as needed.
The cheapest way of destroying the APC currently is using 7 High Velocity Rockets. It is however recommended to bring a few more just in case you miss.
Using three Timed Explosive Charges or 8 Rockets works as well, but it is much more expensive.
Note that the APC will start regenerating its health if left undamaged for at least 5 minutes.

*Satchel Charges have a chance to dud. When they do, they will fall to the ground and can be picked up again. This can be very tricky while Bradley is still alive.
