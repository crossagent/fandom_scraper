# Cold

At night it gets cold, stay warm by either making a campfire, or by putting on some clothes. You gain hunger faster when cold. When in a comfort zone (next to a camp fire) on the other hand you regenerate health faster and become hungry less quickly.
# Radiation

If your rad level goes above 500 you will have radiation poisoning. You will be unable to heal naturally and will take damage until the rads are metabolized below 500.
# Food

Your food level decreases based on how much you move around and if your body is healing itself, Being cold also uses up a lot more food. Once you reach zero food you will begin taking damage.
# Crafting Window

You can craft items by selecting them in the crafting window, as long as you have the required ingredients you can create it; You can learn to craft new items by studying blueprints.
# Trading/Dropping items

You can drop items into the world by simply dragging the item onto your view of the world. (NOTE: Items dropped despawn after a very short period of time)
# Gathering

You can gather things with the hatchet. If you kill an animal, use it on it to get meat and cloth. Some rocks also give you Ores which you can put into a furnace to extract components from (Metal, Sulfur). The hatchet works best for gathering items off animals. The pickaxe is best for gathering everything else. 
# Blueprint

# Item Mods

# Getting stuck

Right now it is possible to fall off the edge of the map, or get stuck in a tight place and your character can't move. If this happens all you have to do is type /do unstuck in the chat window and your character will have its position reset to a random spawn point. This can be used to mess people by teleporting around.
# Choppy objects

Rarely, the client clock can get unsynchronized from the server. If you notice players or zombies teleporting a foot or more instead of walking type/do reclock in the chat window and after a few seconds things should return to normal. Please note this is temporary and will be detected and automated in the near future.
# Input delay

A few users have reported a visual delay between moving their mouse and their view updating. Please visit http://unity3d.com/webplayer and download the latest version.
# Framerate Issues

Go into the options menu and toggle fullscreen. WARNING: sometimes this can lock up your computer. We're looking into it, we think it's a problem with the unity webplayer build.
Alternatively you can toggle things on/off in the options menu or just press / and * on the numpad to decrease/increase graphical settings.
If you have the Unity Editor installed, it helps to download the end user version of their webplayer plugin, the development one runs much slower. Writing "grass.on false" (sometimes you need to type it twice) in F1 may greatly help on the framerate issues.
