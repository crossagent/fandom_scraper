{'title': 'Flare (Legacy)', 'content': 'Flares are an item in Rust. Flares are used to create a source of temporary light at night so that players could navigate the world. Players can hold a lit flare (left mouse button with flare equipped) and hold it in their hand to create a mobile source of light which moved with the player, or players could light a flare and throw it (right mouse button with flare equipped) to create a stationary source of light which remained static in the world. If the player swaps the flare with anything else it will disappear into the void.\nAs with all light sources, the flare poses the risk of making it easier for enemies to see the user.\nFlares can be thrown and light up an area without the item being held, hopefully making the enemy visible and creating glare, for nightly raids or engagements of any kind during nighttime.\nFlares could be thrown into the air to signal teammates to a place where the team could regather (a rally point).\nA thrown flare lasts for approximately 1.5 minutes.\nIts also a ingredient for the Explosive Charge (Legacy).', 'infobox': 'Flare (Legacy)\nType\nTools\nWeapon Stats\nCapacity\n10\nCrafting\nCraftable\nYes\nKnown by default\nNo\nIngredients\nx8x8\nDescription\n"No Item description available"'}
