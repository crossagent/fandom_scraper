# Usage

You can use Anti-Radiation Pills by opening your inventory, then entering the items interaction menu and clicking on 'Take Pills'. The pills will then instantly reduce your radiation by 25, but will also reduce your Hydration by 50. 
# Notes

Be cautious of becoming dehydrated when consuming Anti-Radiation Pills as your movement speed will become impaired, therefore making it harder to escape radiated zones.
