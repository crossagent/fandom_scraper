{'title': 'How to survive', 'content': "Hello if you are reading this you have played rust and are having a hard time, or you are thinking of buying it well I'll get to the point. Some of my main problems in rust are \nbuilding shelter\nwolves\nfood\nSo I'm here to tell you how to deal with those problems, we'll tackle wolves first. So a problem I see constantly is I'll build a house get meat and weapons and a wolf shows up and kills me every time! But what do these attempts have in common? Meat wolves are attracted to fallen animals. But how do you get food without meat? There is food boxes and air drops but they're inconsistent, so what I've learned to do is look for corn and pumpkins around the world and take them they will give you two seeds and one pumpkin\\corn, replant the seeds in a safe place and let it grow no work needed. that takes care of food too so here's housing. It took me a while too figure out how to make a house. What I've learned I can tell you in a couple steps easy ones really a noob could do it.\n \nmake paper (press Q to enter crafting)\nmake a building plan (blue paper looking thing)\nslot it in your hot bar\nbuild a foundation with it.\nhold right click to see the building menu\nselect the structure wall floor foundation. etc.\nThat's all for now comment any suggestions for things I should add,\nand goodbye\n "}
