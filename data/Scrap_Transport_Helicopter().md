# Information

The Scrap Transport Helicopter (often referred to by the community as "scrap heli") is a flying vehicle that has 2 seats for 1 pilot and 1 passenger and a large, open area at the back capable of storing more people. These "free passengers" are able to do everything, as they are technically not sitting in the helicopter.
# Acquisition

This vehicle can be bought from Bandit Camp for 1250 Scrap. 
# Durability

The Scrap Transport Helicopter has a maximum of 1000 HP. Like any other vehicle in Rust, it will decay over time. If it is not located inside a base, it will decay in 3 hours, if it is inside one, it will despawn after 6 hours. 
It can be repaired using a Hammer with Metal Fragments.
Shooting at it will also cause it to get damaged and eventually explode. Crashing it will cause it to explode.
It offers greater defense for the passengers than the Minicopter, but also is a bigger target, therefore easier to shoot at.
# Fuel consumption

It consumes 1800 Low Grade Fuel per hour or 30 per minute of flight (same as the Minicopter). Fuel can be loaded into it at the two red Fuel Tanks located on the sides. Although having 2 seperate Fuel Tanks, they are the same storage. A maximum of 500 fuel can be loaded into it.
