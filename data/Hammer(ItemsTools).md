# Upgrading Structures

The hammer can be used to upgrade building structures from Twig to Wood, Stone, Sheet Metal, or Armoured tier. However, while under attack the structures can not be upgraded or repaired for 30 seconds from the last point of damage.
# Repairing Structures

The hammer can also be used to repair structures from any tier. Strike the structure that requires repair and if the correct raw material for the structure (Wood for Twig and Wood tier, Stone for Stone tier, Metal Fragments for Sheet Metal tier and High Quality Metal for Armored tiers) is in the inventory, the structure will be repaired if enough materials are present.
# Rotating and Removing

The hammer can also be used to rotate or pickup certain structures, such as AutoTurrets, Lanters and Lights, Windows and so forth. Note that the Hammer is unable to pick up every available structure (EG: High External Walls)
To remove an object, simply hold E on the object with the hammer in hand and select "Pickup". Objects will take a small amount of damage upon being collected and can be repaired once placed back on the ground. Note that some objects (EG: AutoTurrets) will require an empty internal inventory to pickup.
