# How to Start

This will tell you how to get the resources you need, and what order you need to get them in based on my experiences.
# Starting Out

First off, start breaking all the rocks and wood piles you find. Skip trees, they are way too slow.
I would recommend putting it somewhere that gives you an advantage. The advantage can be sight, seclusion, be near resources, whatever. Just don't put it in the middle of a flat area for the world to see. When i started i found a small valley near a radiated industrial area that is easily accessible and there doesn't seem to be much traffic. Again just make sure there is some advantage to where you put your home.
Once you have 20 cloth, enough wood, ammunition, and other miscellaneous items, start to build your home. To build a simple home with only one foundation you will need 1 foundation, 4 pillars, 3 walls, 1 doorway, 1 door and 1 ceiling. This means you need at least 410 pieces of wood. (As a cheaper alternative you could rather build a Wood Shelter.)
As you're getting wood make a furnace and start getting metal fragments, sulfur, and charcoal with your ore, sulfur, and some logs so that you can craft a gun. While this stuff is being smelted in the fire continue getting wood and ores but keep an eye on the fire. Once the ores are done make a Revolver or a Pipe Shotgun and ammunition for it. Now go collect more wood and kill a couple wolfs or a bear to get the maximum yield of cloth for a sleeping bag.
## Tips

When crafting you can hold
Shift and hit the plus to add 10 crafting items
Ctrl and hit the plus to maximize the amount of crafted items
Make sure your home location has an advantage.
Kill Mutated Bears or Mutated Wolfs, which will drop rare items and blueprints for creating helpful items such as weapons, iron doors, etc.
When you go to logout make sure you put valuable in your inventory so while you are offline, if you get griefed you take some if not all the risk out of loss of valuables.
Make sure you visit radiated areas, and the more heavily radiated area the better chance of greater loot.
Animals that drop cloth from least yield to most: deer, boar, wolf, bear.
Get a Research Kit ASAP. This will allow you to select items and learn to build them. To use them drag a single piece of paper to the item you wish to learn how to create.
To tell if a wall/door is damaged, it will be darker in color.
Don't try hatcheting at aggressive animals, it can be risky and hard for unexperienced players.
