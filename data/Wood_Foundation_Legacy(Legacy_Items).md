# Crafting

Wooden Foundations may be crafted with 8 Wood Planks in the crafting menu.
# Dependent Structures

The following structures require a Wood Foundation to be placed before the item itself is placed:
Wood Pillar
Wood Wall
Wood Window
Wood Stairs
Wood Ramp
Wood Doorway
# Issues

Various players have been reporting that the Wood Foundation will break immediately upon placement despite it appearing green first during placement. This is most likely a bug. Some players reported resolving the problem by restarting the server. It is advisable to craft and test one Wood Foundation first before attempting to craft multiple ones to see if the problem exists and to avoid wasting wood.
