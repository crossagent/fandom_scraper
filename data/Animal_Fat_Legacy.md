# Animal Fat (Legacy)

Animal fat is collected by hatcheting dead animals such as:
Bear
Boar
Deer
Wolf
When using a hatchet on one of these dead animals you will receive a random number of animal fat, while also getting Cloth, Leather, Raw Chicken Breast and Blood.
Only Bears drop Leather.
Animal fat is used in the crafting recipe for Low Grade Fuel, which is used for the Furnace, Repair Bench, and Explosives.
