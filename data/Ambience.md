# Ambience

"Ambience" is an effect used in many games, and is very simple. Basically, the term ambience refers to the natural, "background" noises that can be heard in the world. In Rust, only the Experimental version has ambience, such as seagull and tide noises when coming near bodies of water, and animal sounds when going into wooded areas. In Experimental Rust, the volume of ambience can be adjusted in the in-game settings, or the "F2" key by default (only works while in a world.)
