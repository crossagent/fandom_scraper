# Starting Out


## Finding Your Food

Firstly, you will awaken on an island with nothing but 2 items. You will have a "Rock", and a "Torch". If you want to survive, your first objective should be finding food. There are two ways to do this and it really depends on where you spawn and the abundance of resources. If you spawn in a place that has plenty of animals, then you should look for a boar. These animals run very slowly and with a little effort you will be able to kill them with your rock. You could also attempt to kill a zombie using your rock but this can be a rather hard task to achieve when starting (Zombies removed to prevent DayZ clone). When collecting from the animal you killed, you want to hit it repeatedly with your rock or any other tool or weapon until the corpse disappears. A pickaxe is the worst tool for collecting resources from animals. Another way is to simply find some people on the server who will be willing to help you out with some food, although most people may just shoot you. (press f1 for console, type grass.on false, this will remove grass and let you see chickens and rabbits which are the easiest to kill.)
## Cooking Your Food

If you have chosen to attack a zombie, then chances are you will have tinned food and that's fine, you can eat that and your hunger will be relieved. However, when you have some raw meat, it will need to be cooked. To do this, you should craft a campfire and then cook your meat. Press the "Tab Key" to bring up the Menu and look towards the top of the screen. Here, there is a button saying "craft" and you should click that to bring up crafting where you will be able to scroll through a list of items available to craft. Click "Campfire" to see the number of resources required to build it. Yep, that's right! You need wood! After you get some wood, you have to HOLD E OVER THE CAMPFIRE AND CLICK OPEN. NOTE: By default, middle-mouse/scroll wheel click, when clicked, also opens this interface while looking at the item.This will allow you to cook that meat by dragging it into the "cook" slots. It takes a while for the food to cook but it should output cooked meat after a while.
An extra thing to note. If you split your meat into three different piles it will cook faster with less resources used. 1 wood will be consumed to cook 2 raw meat in each pile.
## Getting Wood

There are multiple ways to get wood in the game, and the easiest is to simply hit trees. When you hit a tree, there is a chance you will get some wood. This is fine if you just need a little wood to create a campfire, but not very effective when you want to start building. You can also kill other players or search boxes for wood. By now, you're probably bored of using your super slow rock and you want a hatchet! To craft a hatchet, you need stone.
## Getting Stones

The best way of getting stone is to extract them from the boulders that spawn around the map using your rock or a hatchet. These boulders give resources such as "Sulfur Ore", "Metal Ore" and "Stone". The ores can be used in a furnace to create "Metal Fragments" and "Sulfur" which can be used to make things such as Metal, Weapons, Explosives and more. But before you need a furnace, you must craft one, but it's best we make a shelter first.
## Getting A Shelter

Simple, you craft a "wooden shelter" which requires plenty of wood and then you should also get a wooden door. This wooden door will protect you fairly well, but can be slowly broken down using a hatchet and instantly with an explosive. You should try and hide your shelter unless you've found some reliable and good friends. After you've got your shelter, you can make a furnace in it.
## Setting Your Spawn

You must create a sleeping bag and place it somewhere. You do not have to interact with it any further and this will become your default "CAMP SPAWN" point which enables you to create a home. However, you can just spawn in a bag every four minutes. If you Click Campspawn before the five minutes are over, you will spawn at the bag you planted before.
Tip: Set more bags in one area, so you can respawnppear in the crafting menu). Blueprints allow you to make cool weapons like explosives and M4 guns and even Kevlar armour to defend yourself. There also research kits that you can use along with a workbench to learn how to make and item...you drag the kit onto the item(need 1 piece of paper)...say a leather pants and ta-da you can now craft leather pants.
An effective way to kill single zombies is wever, there are plenty of true heartless survivors out there so be very cautious as it's sometimes best to run! Remember. there is strength in numbers.
# Useful Information

Doors CAN be broken down. Wooden doors are much easier to break than Iron doors but explosive charges can destroy any door. The best method to protect yourself I've discovered is to have doors within doors (Now unable to be done). You can also set passwords on your doors so you can share bases with friends by holding 'E'.
the hunting bow. One arrow for regular and red zombies, and 4 arrows for black zombies (they dropne is much more powerful than you, it's best to not approach them with a weapon and they may spare you. However, there are plenty of true heartless survivors out there so be very cautious as it's sometimes best to run! Remember. there is strength in numbers.

You can die of radiation poisoning. Be careful when near zombies and look at the bottom right of your screen. You may hear a weird, constant crackling sound and the "Rads" text may increase. If you get more than 500 rads then you will be poisoned and will have to leave the zone and eat food to lower rads and recover
Sleeper servers will KEEP YOUR wever, there are plenty of true heartless survivors out there so be very cautious as it's sometimes best to run! Remember. there is strength in numbers.

EVEN WHEN YOU LOG OFF. When you log off on a sleeper server, then your character will appear unconscious to other users and they will be able to kill you so please be careful and log out in a safe place. They can loot you and your house if unprotected.
If you are having problems in the game and the grass is glitching or if the speed is very slow, then press the F1 KEY on your keyboard (or the key that opens your console) and type: "grass.on false" as is.
Small Stashes allow you to place your items in a bag and then when you walk away it will appear invisible to everybody including yourself and then will re-appear if you (or someone else) gets close enough. Beware: These stashes will de-spawn after 24 hours of non-use. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Weapons mods can be added to your gun IF the gun has at least one little white square on its icon (the number of squares = the number of mod slots) and you can attach the mod by dragging the mod onto the gun.
If in doubt, give them all a shout! To talk in game, press "Enter" to ask the people questions and they are usually happy to answer. Also, if you wish to talk in game using voice chat then HOLD V. Be careful while talking in game to your friends, don't give out door passwords or talk about your valuablesâ€”bandits could be listening.
