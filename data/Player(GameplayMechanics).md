# Player Abilities

Currently players are able to craft objects, construct houses, operate firearms and collect resources via a variety of tools. Currently players are able to create traps, build houses, and even run servers. There are no limitations on the abilities, which is a part of Rust. In essence Rust is a huge experiment to see how players band together to form the world as they implement more objects into the world.
# Notes

In previous versions of Rust, players had the ability to learn new crafting recipes by finding Blueprints or Research Kits.
In Legacy, only one player model existed which resulted in everybody looking exactly the same. Players could however, craft and wear different clothes and armor to help distinguish themselves from other players.
