# Damage and function times

The Satchel Charge is an unreliable raiding tool that can be used to destroy player-made buildings for the purpose of entering other players bases and looting them.
The Satchel charge becomes armed when placed, has a random time until detonation, and has a small chance to malfunction, requiring the user to pick up and rearm.

Crafting a Satchel Charge requires:
4 Beancan Grenades
1 Small Stash
1 Rope
It takes 30 seconds to craft a single Satchel Charge, using the aforementioned raw materials.
