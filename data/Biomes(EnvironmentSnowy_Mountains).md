# Temperate

 
## Temperate grassland Plains

A temperate, grassy, usually spacious biome that is a commonly seen environment. The temperature is not too hot or cold at daytime, and at nighttime is a relatively warm 1-4 degrees Celsius, enough to barely keep the player from taking damage to Cold. This is often a spawning area for mineable Rocks and Barrels. There is also a moderate chance that you will encounter animals here. Being fairly flat, this biome is ideal for building bases and structures. There is a chance of finding plants that give Hemp, a higher chance near Trees.
## Temperate grassland Hills

Like the Grassland Plains, but with many hills, slightly uneven terrain and little vegetation (aside from grass).
## Temperate Forest

A biome where there tends to be a fairly dense quantity of trees, such as birch and oak trees. Animal spawning is increased here, and sometimes one can find a river or road crossing through it. Common fauna found here include everything from deer to bears, to horses, chickens and beyond. 
# Desert

 
Also known as "Arid" Biome, a warmer, hotter part of the world usually found in the south side of the map. Deserts are usually quite big, expansive, and sandy. Animal spawns here are slightly higher than that of Grassland, and the Desert is a common place to find barrels, Radtowns, and Roads. The parts of the Desert bordering the ocean are often spawning points for players. Vegetation is scarce, but one can easily find the odd Cactus, shrub or Mushroom lying around. During the night, the Desert will make a player Cold without Clothing or a Camp Fire, as temperatures average under -2°C. Due to its close proximity to player spawn points, the Desert will often be swarming with player activity. Once in a while, you may come across a small pond, a little grove of trees or an isolated cluster of rocks/rock formations. Although there is scarce vegetation, there are often many more Sulfur Nodes than in grass biomes.
# Snow

In the north part of the map can be found this snow-covered ground, aka Arctic. Parts of it do not make the player Cold during the day; almost all of it will do so at night. High elevation has a similar effect. After a brief period when resources were spread more evenly across the map, the Cold biome once again has more Metal Rocks than others. Back when Crude Oil could still be gathered with a Mining Quarry, Quarries placed in the Cold biome would produce more Metal than Crude Oil. 
# Beach

Usually, right alongside a body of water there will be a beach: an isolated strip of sand that is (by the game) considered an arid biome. Oceanside beaches are commonly player spawn points, and usually one would want to build their base away from this area to avoid heavy traffic. Beach Biomes had Driftwood from early on; Driftwood was made a harvestable wood Resource with Devblog 167.
Beach biomes are very similar to Arid biomes, however with the new ProcGen 10 world generation engine, there are now different types of beaches:
Desert beaches - Your typical, sandy, warm beach. Found between a large water body and a desert. Palm trees can be found scattered around in this biome. There is often driftwood scattered across the beach, as well as a large density of pickable rocks on the ground.
Temperate beaches - Sometimes just exposed dirt instead of sand. The vegetation generation is different. For example, trees found here are much like those of the Temperate Forest. Mushrooms are vastly more common here than in most other areas or biomes.
Tundra beaches - Cold, dirt beaches that often have rocks and maybe mushrooms lying around in them. Even though these beaches are only at sea level, you will still feel cold (but to a lesser extent). Often times you can find wolves, bears, deer, and other fauna walking around.
Rocky beaches - Similar to Temperate or Desert beaches, but there are many rocks that vary in size, dotting the coast. Cliffs, overhangs, and many other natural structures are often found here.
Lake beaches - These tend to be smaller than their oceanic counterparts. They correspond with the biomes they are in.
## Lake

The Lake biome is a small body of water, which can vary in depth from roughly a player's height to about 12 meters (36 ft, or the height of about 4 stories). In a Lake, you may find small concrete bridges, which are indestructible and world-spawned. You may also find miniature beaches. It is possible for there to be small streams and rivers which flow into the lake, and maybe (rarely) even a waterfall. Sphere Tanks and Satellite Dishes are among some of the monuments that can be found near a lake.
## River/Stream

A small, fairly shallow flowing path of water which flows from higher elevations down to a large, nearby body of water. Sometimes, there will be rivers that connect lakes and oceans, as well as rivers that start way up in the mountains. If there is a road crossing the river, you will find an indestructible, concrete bridge leading across.
Rivers may be surrounded by rocks, shrubs, or even forests.
## Ocean

 
A very huge body of water that surrounds the entire map. The Ocean tends to get very deep, very fast away from the shoreline. Beaches beside the ocean are often where players respawn. Any beaches surrounding the ocean often have pieces of Driftwood scattered across their lengths.
# Notes

A Rust day is 45 minutes long, and the night is 15 minutes.
Being in water reduces temperature, and obviously once the player runs out of air they Drown
