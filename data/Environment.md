Main Article: Biomes
The default terrain of the procedural map is broken into three distinct biomes: Desert, Grass and Snow.
## Arctic

 
The snowy area seems to have more nodes and less trees. However, you may find some snowy forest areas which contain an abundance of trees. The cold will reach very low here and players require clothing to survive. The best starter item for players who are looking to beat the cold would be a full burlap set with an Improvised Balaclava. This will give decent cold protection and requires no Sewing Kits to make.
## Arid

 
The desert is a hot southern region filled with mineral rocks, barrels, and palm trees. At night it can get cold, so desert survival requires suitable clothing or a Camp Fire to keep warm. It is the only biome in which cacti may be found, which yield cactus flesh and cloth.
## Temperate

 
The Grassy region is generally the most popular on a map due to the temperate climate and abundance of flora and fauna. Because of the popularity, mineral rocks and barrels are sometimes difficult to find at peak hours.

# Trivia

The arctic biome had been removed, and was re-introduced again, the likely cause for the original removal was that it was fairly abundant with resources and there weren't many downsides, as a geared player's base would be protected from new spawns.
