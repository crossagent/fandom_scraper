# Use

The Large Furnace is used just like its normal sized counterpart. Simply put in a fuel source, some ore, and turn it on. The Large Furnace will then burn until it is turned off, or it runs out of fuel. To smelt ores faster, split them up and distribute them evenly across multiple slots. Just be sure to leave three slots open: one for the fuel source, one for the refined product, and one for the charcoal!

# Notes

It takes 120 seconds to craft one Large Furnace.
The large furnace has 18 slots (3 times that of the normal furnace)
The rate of smelting does not differ in the large furnace. It allows for more simultaneous smelting.
The Large Furnace costs 100 less Stone and half the Low Grade Fuel than its equivalent, three regular Furnaces, would cost. Compared with the amount of wood used by a regular furnace, it burns about 40% as much wood for Metal Ore, 80% when making Sulfur, and about one third for High Quality Metal. The ratio of wood to charcoal is the same for both furnaces; an amount exactly or almost exactly equal to three quarters of the amount of wood burned.
Must be placed on open terrain, It cannot be placed on a foundation. Update: As of devblog 159 or 160 they can now be placed inside with a floor grill above (for ventilation) so they can now be secured in your base.
Cannot be placed on steep hills.
For truly huge operations, the consideration of total space becomes greater, and it may be preferable to spend more on wood and keep the building footprint smaller, with a giant room full of normal Furnaces.
