# Layout

The Sewer Branch consists of a few shacks on its cliff edges as well as a metal tower and cave beneath the cliff edges. A green keycard puzzle is also available to solve.
# Loot

Barrels and food crates spawn on the perimeter of the Sewer Branch. Inside of the cliff edge shacks players can typically find barrels and basic crates. In the tower and cave beneath the cliff edges you can expect to find basic crates as well as food/medical crates. 
If a player has an Electric Fuse and Green Keycard it is possible to complete a puzzle that leads to a loot room. Beyond the green door players can expect to find 3+ basic crates a Blue Keycard and on occasion, a green military crate.
