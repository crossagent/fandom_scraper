{'title': 'Heavy Scientists', 'content': "Heavy scientists are much more difficult versions of regular scientists, they come to the oil rig when the locked crate is being hacked 6 or 10 can spawn (depending on oil rig size) and alone, pose a very high threat. But are also are the only NPC to have a chance to drop Multiple Grenade Launcher and its ammunition. It's highly recommended to fight them in groups."}
