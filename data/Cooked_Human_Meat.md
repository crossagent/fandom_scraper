# Cooked Human Meat

Cooked Human Meat is a more nutritious version of Human Meat. It is cooked by placing it into an active Campfire. After a short duration of time, the meat will be cooked. However, if it cooks too long, it will become Burned Human Meat. There is no chance that consuming it will poison you. If Human Meat of any kind is stored improperly or for too long, it will become Spoiled Human Meat. As of a recent update, Human meat now has a significant salt count, and will dehydrate the consumer, possibly to prevent players from killing and re spawning over and over to obtain a stable amount of food without easy access to safe water.
