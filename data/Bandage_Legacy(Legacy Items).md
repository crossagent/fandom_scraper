## Usage

The Bandages could be used by a player by putting it into the Hotbar and pressing the specified key of 1-6. Players could could also use it from anywhere in their Inventory by hovering their mouse over the item and then clicking on it with their right-mouse button after which they could select the Use option.
## Obtaining

Bandages could be obtained in three different ways:
By crafting them;
Finding them in Loot Crates;
Looting Rad Animals.
## Crafting

Bandages could be crafted using 2 Cloth. Doing so would take 10 seconds and yielded one Bandage. Crafting it near a Workbench would reduce the crafting time to 3.3 seconds.
