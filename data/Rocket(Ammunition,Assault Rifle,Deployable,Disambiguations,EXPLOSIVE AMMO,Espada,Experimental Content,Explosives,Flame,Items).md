# Trivia

Note: There are three different types of rockets:
The Incendiary Rocket, painted red, and has the capability to cause fires to buildings/players.
The High Velocity Rocket, that has increased range/accuracy, however, does 40% less damage to buildings (75 damage).
All rockets laying on the ground share the same view model.
Rockets will not explode unless fired from a Rocket Launcher.
The Smoke Rocket is no longer available in vanilla rust. It created a thick cloud of smoke to blind enemies, for gaining ground on offense or gaining time on defense.
