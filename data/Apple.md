# Apple

â€”Information accurate as of: 904.83 Update
Apples are a food item in Rust. They are currently found in Food Crates. Apples have no world model as of yet, so they will appear as a brown bag when thrown on the ground.
When ingested, the Apple gives a small amount of health and refills hunger and thirst bars slightly. Apples have no chance of poisoning the user upon consumption, and are completely safe to eat. However, improperly storing an Apple or storing it for too long will turn the Apple into a Rotten Apple. Apples cannot be cooked.
