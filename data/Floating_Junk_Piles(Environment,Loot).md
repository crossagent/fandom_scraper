# Approaching

 
Floating Junk Piles generally spawn within viewing distance from the shore. They can be visited by simply swimming out to them, although it's not recommended, because it's a very slow method. Using a Boat or an RHIB is more advisable, since it's a more efficient travel method on water. 
# Loot

 
Floating Junk Piles typically have several Barrels on top of it. Some rafts also support Loot Crates and/or Tool Boxes. Once all the loot has been taken the Floating Junk Pile will begin to sink. After sinking to a certain depth they simply disappear. Floating Junk Piles cannot be moved.
Floating Junk Piles are typically safer to loot since you can see other players coming from quite a distance. However, beware of hostile players in boats as they can approach quite fast.
