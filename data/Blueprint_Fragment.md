# Info

â€”Information accurate as of: win/723512dev Update
The Blueprint Fragment is part of the Blueprints system.
Blueprint Fragments are commonly found in barrels/crates.
The lower the quality of loot found inside the barrels/crates, the more likely one will find these.
You can either gather 20 together to construct a random common blueprint or combine 60 to make a higher tier Blueprint Page.
Blueprint fragments are no longer in the game after the update of July 7th.
